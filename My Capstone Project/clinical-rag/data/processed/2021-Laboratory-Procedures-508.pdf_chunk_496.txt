limits: 
– WBC 2.5  
– RBC  2.0 
– HGB  1.5 
– MCV 2.0  
– PLT  5.0 
– MPV  3.0 
• Check the low to high difference (bottom line) for the Diff parameters with these limits:  
– NE%  ≤ 4.8 
– LY% ≤ 4.8  
– MO%  ≤ 3.2  
– EO%  ≤ 1.6 
– BA%  ≤ 1.6  
If any of the results are outside the limits, call Beckman Coulter c ustomer s ervice.  
• If all the results are within these parameters: Print >Select  “Finish ” and proceed with 
Carryover Check . 
Use the %CV line for CBC parameters only and the Diff line for the differential parameters only.
