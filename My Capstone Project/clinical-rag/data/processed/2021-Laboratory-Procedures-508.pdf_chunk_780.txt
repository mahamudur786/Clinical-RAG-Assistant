to determine if it is performing correctly and patient results are reportable. The term “quality assurance ” (QA) rep resents the entire process used to ensure with a specified degree of confidence 
that the result reported by the laboratory is correct. Both “precision control” (the agreement between replicate measurements) and “ accuracy control ” (the agreement between the mean estimate 
of a quantity and its true value) are evaluated to establish this degree of confidence.  
A QA program also monitors laboratory performance to detect excessive random or systematic
