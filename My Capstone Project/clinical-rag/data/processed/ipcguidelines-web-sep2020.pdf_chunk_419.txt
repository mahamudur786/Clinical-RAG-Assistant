required. This is particularly important in epidemic/ pandemic situations.
Pandemic preparedness
Time and again emerging and re-emerging diseases have caused epidemic and pandemic situations. The major international outbreaks in the last decade have been: Swine ﬂ  u in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014 and Zika in 2016 and Nipah 
in India (2018). In outbreaks of public health importance, the ﬁ  rst point of contact 
in an HCF is the OPD or the emergency department. Staff at the frontline must be prepared to identify and transfer cases safely without disease transmission. Preparation for all diseases should include screening and isolating potentially infectious persons, PPE use, cleaning and disinfection and drill exercises.
