Before putting on PPE
x HCWs should be trained on the use of PPE as part of the IPC training.
x The training should address the protocols adopted by a speciﬁ  c facility and 
include practising both putting on and taking off procedures and performing care-related activities while wearing PPE.
x The competency of the HCWs in using PPE should be assessed and tested 
and, ideally, properly documented.
 Procedures and practices for IPC 45
x Adequate resources (human, material and ﬁ  nancial) must be made available.
x Management of the resources should include stock management, availability of 
different sizes and shapes of PPE, placement of items for easy access, quality of items purchased and line management for reporting shortages.
