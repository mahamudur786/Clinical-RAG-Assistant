Guidelines on Core Components of Infection Control Programmes11 have been 
formulated to help countries develop strategies to improve and strengthen IPC programmes (Box 1.2). The guidelines provide evidence- and consensus-based recommendations on the core components that are required to be in place at the national and acute facility level to prevent HAI, and to combat current and future infection threats and AMR through IPC good practices. The guideline document is supported by a practical manual for implementation.
