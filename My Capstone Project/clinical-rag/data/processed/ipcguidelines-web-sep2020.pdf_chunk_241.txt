Advantages Suitable for all 
climates and weatherSuitable for warm 
and temperate climatesSuitable for most 
climates and weather
More controlled 
and comfortable environmentLower capital, 
operational, maintenance costs for simple implementationEnergy saving 
relative to mechanical ventilation
Occupants have 
limited control to affect ventilationCapable of achieving 
very high ventilation ratesMore ﬂ  exible
Disadvantages Expensive to instal 
and maintainEasily affected by 
outdoor climate and occupant’s behaviourMay be more costly 
or difﬁ  cult to design
Can fail to deliver 
required ventilation rates through faulty design, maintenance or operationMay be difﬁ  cult to 
plan, design, and predict performance
Noise from 
equipmentReduced comfort 
level of occupants in extreme weather
