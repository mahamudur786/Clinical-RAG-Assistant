but the work should also be planned to minimize the number of times an operator’ s han ds and arms 
must enter and leave the air curtain at the open face. The ideal situation is to have everything needed 
for the complete procedure placed in the hood before starting, so that nothing need pass in or out through the air barrier at the face until the procedure is completed. This is especially important in 
working with moderate risk agents.  
Unnecessary raising of the hands inside the cabinet above the level of the work opening should be 
avoided. This presents an inclined plane from hands to elbows along which the downflow of air may run to, and possibly out of , the open face.
