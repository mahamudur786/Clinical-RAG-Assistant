7.5 Blood -Processing Procedures  
If centrifugation is required (i.e., red top tubes), centrifuge all blood specimens unopened, then 
transport to, and uncap and process in, the laminar flow hood. The laminar flow hood provides a HEPA -filtered, recirculated mass airflow  within the workspace and protects from any release of 
aerosol that may occur when opening the Vacutainer® tubes or when pouring or pipetting the specimens. It also prevents drawing contaminated air or dust over the specimens. It is mandatory to use the bl ower.  
Always wear gloves when handling specimens. Check gloves for small holes or tears. Change gloves 
if they become visibly contaminated with blood. Immediately soak visibly contaminated racks in
