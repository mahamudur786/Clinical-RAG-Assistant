Record a comment for all insufficient urine collections. The laboratory application will automatically 
assign the comment code “quantity not sufficient” for all urine collections that are calculated as 
QNS by the scale application. The laboratory technician may also assign this comment code to all 
samples that are changed to QNS during the verification process. As mentioned above, the “blood/clot contamination ” comment supersedes the “quantity not sufficient” comment code.
