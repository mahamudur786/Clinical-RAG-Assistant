drinking water sources. The samples should show absence of coliform organisms.
Disinfection of water sources
Water sources and tanks may be disinfected by adding chlorine in the form of bleaching powder, high strength calcium hypochlorite or liquid bleach. The quantity of the chemicals needed to disinfect water for drinking can be calculated, the dose being approximately 0.7 mg of applied chlorine per litre of water.
The testing of water sources for free chlorine is done to measure the potability of 
water. The presence of free chlorine should be at 0.2 ppm, which indicates that an adequate amount of chlorine was added to inactivate the contaminating bacteria and viruses and that the water would be free from contamination during storage.
