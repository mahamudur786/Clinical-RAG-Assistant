Environmental hygiene and sanitation

raw material, storage of material, facility for storing perishable items, i.e. cold storage, facility for “ﬁ  rst in ﬁ  rst out” particularly for raw food such as onions and 
potatoes. Adequate supply of clean (potable) water should be ensured.
x Raw material cutting surfaces should be segregated because raw material 
such as spinach and vegetables with roots bring in soil and dirt. 
x Food should be served as soon as possible after preparation.
Water
Uninterrupted potable water and hot water supply should be available in the kitchen.
