6.2.1  Coulter Method  
In 1956, Wallace C oulter described the  Coulter Principle as follows: A suspension of blood cells is 
passed through a small orifice simultaneously with an electric current.  The individual blood cells 
passing through the orifice introduce an impedance change in the orifice de termined by the size of 
the cell.  
Each cell suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent) acts as an insulator. As each cell passes through 
the aperture, it momentarily increases the resistance of the electrical path between the submerged electrodes on either  side of the aperture.  This causes a measurable electronic pulse.  For purposes of
