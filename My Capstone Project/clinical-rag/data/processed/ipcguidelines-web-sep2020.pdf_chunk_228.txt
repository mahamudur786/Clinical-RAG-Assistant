streptococcal disease, pertussis, diphtheria and inﬂ  uenza, mumps. 
During an inﬂ  uenza pandemic, the circulating human virus is expected to be 
transmitted in the same manner as seasonal inﬂ  uenza viruses. Hence, droplet precautions should be applied in addition to standard precautions.
Droplet precautions include:x Patient placement: keep a minimum of 1–2 metre inter-bed distance.
x Cough etiquette: explain the importance of respiratory hygiene and cough 
etiquette to patients.
x Personal protective equipment: wear a triple-layered surgical mask within 1–2 
metres of the patient. For practical purposes, it is advisable to use the mask when entering the patient’s room. For aerosol-generating procedures, N95 masks should be used.
