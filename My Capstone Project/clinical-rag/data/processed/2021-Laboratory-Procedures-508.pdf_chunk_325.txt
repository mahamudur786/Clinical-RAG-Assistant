• If there is any delay in processing urine, place the sample in the refrigerator until it can 
be processed. 
• If there are multiple urine cups from the same SP, verify the SP name and ID on each 
cup. Pool urine samples into the most recently collected cup ( i.e., pour CC1 into CC2 ), 
cover , and swirl before aliquoting. Discard CC1 after redacting SP personally 
identifiable information. 
• Where indicated, perform the pregnancy test and record results before aliquoting the 
urine specimen. 
• Label all urine aliquot vessels for the SP and arrange them in priority order. 
Using the 3.5 mL pipet, al iquot the urine sample for each of these tests using the procedure shown
