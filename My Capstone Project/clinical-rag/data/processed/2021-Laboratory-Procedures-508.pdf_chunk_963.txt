10.4. 1.2 Rotor Care and Maintenance  
Note: Do not use sharp tools on the rotor that could cause scratches in the rotor surface. Corrosion 
begins in scratches and may open fissures in the rotor with continued use. 
• At the start of stand, inspect t he rotor yoke and buckets, especially inside cavities, for 
rough spots or pitting, white powder deposits—frequently aluminum oxide— or heavy 
discoloration. 
• If any of these signs are evident, do not run the rotor.
