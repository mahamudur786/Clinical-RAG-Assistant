chair weight restriction for the UMF 8678 chair model is 375 lbs . If the phlebotomist estimates that  
the weight of the SP is less than 375 lbs and the SP will fit comfortably in the phlebotomy chair, then ask the SP to sit in the chair. If the SP exceeds the capacity of the chair, use a chair from the staff lounge to comfortably and safely seat the SP . If the SP feels faint  and is sitting in the electronic 
chair , recline the chair either before or during the blood draw as needed.  
Seating SPs with disabilities if unable to sit in the phlebotomy chair:  
• Roll wheelchairs  completely into the room and engage w heel brakes. Walkers and canes 
can be set aside and out of the way to avoid a potential trip hazard .
