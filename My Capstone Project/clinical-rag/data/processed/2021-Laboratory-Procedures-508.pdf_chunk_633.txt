solution is homogenous.
11. Transfer 1.5 mL  of the  homogenous solution to a 2 mL  cryovial  for vessel 88. Add 1
mL of 1 percent  of ascorbic acid to vessel 221, then add 0.1 of the homogenous
solution to the vessel with rinses. Vortex mix the solution for 5 seconds. For vessel 222
(fatty acids) add 1.6 mL  of the solution to the appropriate cryovial.
A. Close all vessels secure ly to prevent leakage and evaporation .
B. Record results using the Blood Processing module as described in Section 7.6.
