If the system identifies a rotor different than the one entered by the user, the system

displays an error message and  reduces the speed to the maximum allowable speed of the 
rotor.  
• An imbalance detector monitors the rotor during the run, c ausing automatic shutdown 
if rotor loads are severely out of balance. At low speeds, an incorrectly loaded rotor can 
cause  imbalance. Rotor instability can also occur if the centrifuge is moved while 
running, or if it is not resting on a level and secure s urface.
