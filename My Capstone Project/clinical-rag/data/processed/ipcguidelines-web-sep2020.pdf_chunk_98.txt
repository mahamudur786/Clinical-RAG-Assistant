Aerosols containing infectious agents can be dispersed over long distances by air 
currents (e.g. ventilation or air-conditioning systems) and inhaled by susceptible individuals who have not had any contact with the infectious person. Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the airborne route include measles virus, chickenpox (varicella) virus and M. tuberculosis.
Vector-borne transmission
Vector-borne transmission refers to transmission of microorganisms by vectors such 
as mosquitoes and can be prevented by appropriate construction and maintenance of an HCF, having closed or screened windows, and proper housekeeping. Examples of vector-borne diseases include malaria, dengue and chikungunya.
