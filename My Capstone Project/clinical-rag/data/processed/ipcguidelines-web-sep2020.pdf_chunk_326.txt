Provision must be made within the premises of an HCF for a safe, ventilated and 
secured location for storage of segregated biomedical waste in coloured bags or containers, inaccessible to scavengers and protected against insects, birds, animals and rain, to ensure that there is no secondary handling, pilferage of recyclables, or inadvertent scattering or spillage by animals. The biomedical waste from such places or premises should be directly transported to the authorized common biomedical waste treatment facility for the appropriate treatment and disposal.
