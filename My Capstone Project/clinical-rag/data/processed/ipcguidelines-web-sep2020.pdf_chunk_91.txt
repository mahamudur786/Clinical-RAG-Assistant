Gastrointestinal infections
These are common infections in paediatric wards and in the community. Introduced 
in the hospital through an infected patient, such infections can spread rapidly in the paediatric unit through a contaminated environment, toilets and inadequate handwashing.
Infectious diarrhoea is conﬁ  rmed when a bacterial or viral aetiology is demonstrated.
