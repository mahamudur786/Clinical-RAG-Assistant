patient information along with a duly ﬁ  lled specimen referral form.
x Test tube racks or trays must be used to transport specimens in the laboratory.

In evaluating the risks, the key points to consider are the following.x Listing of risk groups for microbiological agents that are involved (see Annex 
12 for classiﬁ  cation of risk groups);
x Pathogenicity of the agent and infectious dose;
x Potential outcome of exposure;
x Natural route of infection;
x Other routes of infection, resulting from laboratory manipulations (parenteral, 
airborne, ingestion);
x Stability of the agent in the environment;
