Respirators: These protect from inhalation of infectious aerosols (e.g. M. 
tuberculosis ). Some types are: particulate respirators, half- or full-face elastomeric 
respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).

The most commonly used respirators in healthcare settings are N95 particulate 
respirators. The device ﬁ  lters particles more than 0.3 microns in diameter. 
Indications for use 
Particulate respirators should be used:
x by care-providers of patients with obligate and preferentially airborne-
transmitted diseases such as TB;
x while performing aerosol-generating procedures that have been consistently 
associated with increased risk of pathogen transmission;
x if an aerosol-generating procedure such as bronchoscopy is performed on a 
patient with active TB; and
