neonates and adults with pertussis may not have paroxysmal or severe cough). The clinician's index of suspicion should be guided by the prevalence of speciﬁ  c conditions in the community, as well as clinical

§ These pathogens include enterohaemorrhagic E. coli  O157:H7, Shigella spp., hepatitis A virus, 
noroviruses, rotavirus, and C. difﬁ  cile.
