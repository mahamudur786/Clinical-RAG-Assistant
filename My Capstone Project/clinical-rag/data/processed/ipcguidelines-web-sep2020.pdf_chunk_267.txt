Pathogenic organisms that survive in the environment can be a source of infection for 
patients admitted in the hospital. Therefore, it is important to clean the environment thoroughly on a regular basis. This will reduce the bacterial load, get rid of soil and make the environment unsuitable for growth of microorganisms.
Hospitals need to practise and maintain the highest standards of hygiene and an 
environment conducive to speedy patient recovery.
