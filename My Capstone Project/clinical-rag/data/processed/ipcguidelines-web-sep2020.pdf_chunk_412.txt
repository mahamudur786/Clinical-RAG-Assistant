x As far as possible procure base solutions such as IV glucose, saline solutions 
in paediatric packings/ small amounts rather than adult packaging and transfer into smaller aliquots. Avoid procurement of multi-dose vials as far as possible; single use ampoules/ vials are preferred.
x Have a designated area to prepare IV infusions. Clean the area with a 
disinfectant before a procedure. 
x Gather the necessary materials (IV ﬂ  uids, drugs, syringes, needles, swabs, 
70% alcohol, etc.).
x Examine the IV ﬂ  uid containers, ampoules and vials for expiry date, cracks, 
leaks, cloudy consistency, ﬂ  akes, etc.
x Perform hand hygiene either by handwashing using medicated soap followed 
by drying with a single-use towel, or ABHR (it is important that hands are dry before starting the procedure).
