an accidental blood splash. In addition, the outlet in the hood provides power to the electronic pipettes. The electronic pipette is required to perform an accurate dilution for ve ssel 3 (RBC Folate) , 
vessel 110 (Folate), and vessel 221 (RBC Folate Forms) . 
Consequences.  The environmental specimens may become contaminated. The pipette will lose 
battery power after 60 minutes.  
Actions . Complete an Unusual Occurrence Log to document the SP IDs of the samples processed 
without a fully functioning hood. This information will be re corded subsequently in an annual 
summary for NCHS.  
• Attach the comment “equipment failure” to v essels 3, 110, and 221.  
• Process v essel 3 immediately so that the specimens are not lost due to battery failure.
