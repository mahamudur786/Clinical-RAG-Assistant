x Student training should be limited to cases that are in active labour.
Prevention of infection before delivery 
x Use clean examination gloves, wash the perineal area (vulva, perineum and 
anal region) with soap and clean water.
x Use downward and backward motion while cleaning so that faecal organisms 
are not introduced into the vagina.
x The anal area should be cleaned last and the wash towel discarded in a 
yellow-coded container. Disinfect gloved hands by immersing in 0.5% chlorine solution, wash gloved hands and remove gloves by inverting and discard in the yellow-coded container.
x Perineal/ pubic hair should not be shaved, hair clipper should be used if 
required. Routine shaving is not recommended by WHO. Shaving has been shown to increase the risk of infection after delivery.
