automated Unusual Field Occurrence (UFO) utility and inform the FES  immediately. If using the 
portable air conditioner , document use for each session by way of a UFO.  
10.4.6 Humidity Monitor  
One humidity monitor monitors the humidity in the laboratory. Quality control procedures for 
room humidity monitoring involve  checking the monitors for damage, monitoring the humidity 
during each session, and documenting any unusual occurrences. Check the humidity monitor for damage at the beginning of each stand.  Notify the warehouse manager of any damage  and request a 
new monitor. 
The allowable room humidity range for the laboratory is <80 percent.
