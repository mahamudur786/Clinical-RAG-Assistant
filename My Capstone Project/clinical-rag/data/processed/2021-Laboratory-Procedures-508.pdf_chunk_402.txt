(reporting u nits 
in US -1 format) Method  Description  
WBC  Coulter 
Principle  White Blood Cell Count or Leukocyte Count  
• Measure directly, multiplied by the calibration factor.  
• Corrected for interference if necessary. If no correction is required, 
then WBC = UWBC.  
• WBC = N x 103 cells/ µL. 
UWBC  Coulter Principle  Uncorrected White Blood Cell  
• Measure directly, multiplied by the calibration factor.  
• UWBC = N x 10
3 cells/ µL.
