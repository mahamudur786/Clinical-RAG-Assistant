Do not allow the outside of the used glove to touch your skin.
x The gloves should be removed before touching anything.
x Rinse gloved hands in a disinfectant solution to remove blood and body ﬂ  uids.
x Partly pull off one of the gloves by grasping it near the cuff.
x Keeping the ﬁ  rst glove partly on, remove the second glove partly to avoid touching the outer 
surface of either glove.
x Both gloves are now turned partially inside out and can together be removed completely 
while avoiding touching the outside of the glove with bare hands.
x Wash hands after removing gloves, since gloves may contain nicks and tears which could 
allow blood and body ﬂ  uids to contaminate the hands.
