A QA program also monitors laboratory performance to detect excessive random or systematic 
error. Random error is defined as a ny deviation from an expected result. There is acceptable or 
expected random error as defined by standard deviation (SD). There is also unacceptable or 
unexpected random error that is any data point outside the expected population of data, such as a data p oint that is outside of ± 3 SD from the expected result. Factors contributing to random error
