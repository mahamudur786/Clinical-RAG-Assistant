Beckman Coulter provides the S- CAL calibrator to meet these requirements. The DxH 800 uses the 
S-CAL kit that requires a calibrator to convert electronic measurements of each sample into accurate 
results expressed in clinic al terms. The S -CAL calibrates the WBC, RBC, Hgb, MCV, Plt, and MPV 
parameters. It is a stabilized human -blood preparation. The S- CAL is an acceptable alternative to 
whole blood calibration. Hct, MCH, MCHC, RDW, and the DIFF parameters do not require 
calibration. 
Calibration is a procedure to standardize the instrument by determining its deviation from 
calibration references and to apply any necessary correction factors. The calibration procedure uses
