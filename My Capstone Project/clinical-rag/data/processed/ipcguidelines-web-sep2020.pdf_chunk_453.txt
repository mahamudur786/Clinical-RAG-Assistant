complete stop; and 
R only open specimen tubes by gently twisting the stoppers and lifting 
them (sometimes holding a lint-free tissue over the stopper may prevent aerosolization). 
x Keep the test request forms, registers and other paper work separate from 
specimen containers since the outer surface of specimen containers may be contaminated.
x Wipe the outer surface of containers with a suitable disinfectant before 
handling.
x Keep the smear preparation area separate from other laboratory activities.
x Open containers carefully to minimize production of aerosols.
x Keep the container open only long enough to remove a portion for direct smear 
preparation if not processing for culture.
