of stability/ improvement on ventilator, VAP is recognized by the following criteria:117
x Worsening oxygenation
x Temperature >38 °C or <36 °C, or white blood cell count t12 000 cells/mm3 or 
d4000 cells/mm3
 Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 145
x Purulent respiratory secretions (>25 neutrophils and <10 squamous cells/low 
power ﬁ  eld) and positive microbiology culture of either sputum, endotracheal 
aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissue, protective specimen brush (Box 7.2). 
The deﬁ  nition criteria for VAP has many limitations in its differentiation from other 
complications that occur in mechanically ventilated patients. 
Calculation of incidence
x Device days and patient-days are used for denominators.
