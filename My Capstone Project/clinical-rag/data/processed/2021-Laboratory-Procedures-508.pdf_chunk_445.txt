conditions should mimic routine testing as closely as possible.

– View the mean and SD of the parameters using the QC menu on the DXH 800. 
Reviewing the Levey -Jennings plots for each of the parameters may identify drifts 
or shifts in the results over time, or a highly deviant result (see 6.11.10 for Levy -
Jennings graph information). If no pronounced drifts, shifts, or outliers are seen, 
use the 20 data points to establish the mean and SD for the instrument (see 
Exhibit 6- 3 for examples) . Since the MEC la boratory runs multiple controls per 
day, the long-term SD may be underestimated and will need to be monitored. 
– This mean should be within the range stated on the control assay sheet and is 
considered the established target value .
