Reference ranges for normal values were calculated from the NHANES data set (1999 –2004) using 
95 percent  reference interval(s) determined nonparametrically, through ranking the observations and 
determining the lower (2.5th percentile) and the upper (97.5th percentil e) reference limits.  The 
nonparametric (ranking) method was used because most measured hematology parameters have a 
skewed, non-Gaussian distribution. 
6.22 Action Limits 
Action limits are a guide to inform the clinician  that a CBC result(s) is/are abnormal . Since all 
specimens are run in duplicate, there is no reason to retest the sample.
