an excellent marker for the detection of pregnancy.  
The ICON® 25 hCG test is a rapid test that qualitatively detects the presence of hCG in urine 
samples at the sensitivity of 25 mIU/m L. The test u ses a combination of monoclonal and 
polyclonal antibodies to selectively detect elevated levels of hCG in urine. At the level of claimed sensitivity, the ICON
® 25 hCG test shows no cross- reactivity interference from the structurally 
related glycoprotein hormones human follicle stimulating hormone, human luteinizing hormone, 
and human thyroid stimulating hormone at high physiological levels.
