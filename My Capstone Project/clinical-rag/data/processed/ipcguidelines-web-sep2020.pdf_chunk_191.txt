Although PPE is the most visible control used to prevent transmission of infection, 
it must be used in conjunction with administrative and engineering controls. PPE must be correctly selected and used in a safe manner, and must be available and accessible to HCWs and visitors.
Ensure sufﬁ  cient supplies of appropriate PPE
If resources are limited and disposable PPE items are not available, use reusable 
items (e.g. cotton gowns) and disinfect properly after each use. To avoid wastage, critically evaluate situations in which PPE is indicated, and maximize the provision of clinical care during each entry to the patient's room. However, use disposable PPE only while handling risk group 4 organisms or infection due to the same.
