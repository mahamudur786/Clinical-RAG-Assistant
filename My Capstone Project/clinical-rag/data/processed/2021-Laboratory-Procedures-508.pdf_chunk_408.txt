associated electronics and fluidics. Samples prepared at the AMTC are delivered to the 
MTM where the sample detection occurs.  
• CBC Assembly.  The CBC Assembly provides the physical processing elements 
necessary for CBC sample conditioning (combining of reagents and the sample segment, mixing, and incubation) and measurement via the aperture bath assemblies, the Hgb assembly, and the electrical signal conditioning circuits. 
• Common Services Consist of t he Electronic Supply Module, Pneumatic Services,  
and Reagent Services (Supply and Distribution) . Common services provide and
