• The top half of the Quality Control (Graph V iew) screen displays all parameters 
associated with controls. 
– Levey -Jennings graphs display the latest run points for all parameters.  
– Each graph displays up to 10 points, and these change to reflect the scrolling of 
the expanded graph.  
– The points shown in the blue-shaded window of the expanded graph reflect those shown in the thumbnail graphs. 
• The point cursor on the thumbnail graphs is synchronized with the selected run within the data grid and the point cursor in the expanded graph.
