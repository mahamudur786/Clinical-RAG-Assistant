11. Dry Run  
11.1 Overview  
After setting up the phlebotomy and laboratory rooms at each new stand, the staff conducts a “ dry 
run” session using volunteers to verify data and specimen collection and processing procedures. 
One purpose of the dry run session is to help identify any problem areas, particularly with 
equipment, and to resolve the problems before the stand begins. Another purpose is to provide the 
contract laboratories with blind-split samples for quality control determinations. Two distinct IDs 
are assigned to each non- test volunteer—the original SP ID and a second unique s ample ID. 
Document the results of the dry run session in the same manner as an actual session except for  
enter ing the results twice : first using the SP ID and again using the s ample ID.
