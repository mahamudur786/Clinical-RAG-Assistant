Mixing of air can disperse pockets of high concentration of infectious particles, such 
as in the vicinity of patients. 
The total number of infectious particles in the room will not change with mixing. 
Unless adequate ventilation is present, mixing fans will not be useful in dispersing infectious particles and reducing the risk of transmission. 
A common problem with reliance on natural ventilation is that patients or staff close 
windows during cold weather or at night. Further, there is likely to be variability of airﬂ ow patterns due to varying weather. In colder climates where rooms are closed
