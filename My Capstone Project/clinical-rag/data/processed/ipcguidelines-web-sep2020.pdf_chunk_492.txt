Deﬁ nition
SSI refers to an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the 
surgery took place. SSIs can sometimes be superﬁ  cial infections involving the skin 
only. Other SSIs are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs, or implanted material. 
SSI is also deﬁ  ned as an infection that occurs within 30 days after the operation and 
involves the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision (superﬁ  cial incisional) and/
 Healthcare-associated infections and their surveillance 139
or the deep soft tissue (for example, fascia, muscle) of the incision (deep incisional) 
and/or any part of the anatomy (for example, organs and spaces) other than the incision that was opened or manipulated during an operation (organ/ space).
