undertaken to ensure use of the most current and reliable techniques. 
3. Reagents and Materials. This includes confirmation of commercial standards and controls before they reach the bench; proper labeling of reagents, particularly those 
prepared in the laboratory; ensuring all reagents in use are not outdated; having an 
adequate supply of current reliable reagents; and proper calibration of equipment, such as pipettes.
