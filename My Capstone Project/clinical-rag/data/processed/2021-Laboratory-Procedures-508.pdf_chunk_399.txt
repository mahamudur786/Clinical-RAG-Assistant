The VCSn module includes the Air Mix and Temperature Control (AMTC) and the MTM. 
In the flow cell, low -frequency direct curre nt measures volume, while high-frequency (RF) current 
senses cellular internal content through measuring changes in conductivity.

The MTM u ses a flow cell to pass particles through a sensing zone, one particle at a time , and a 
diode laser to illuminate the particles.  The illuminated particles both scatter and absorb a portion of 
the incident light. Sensors strategically placed around the flow cell collect the scattered light of 
interest.  An additional sensor placed in the laser path measures the amount of light removed due to 
light scatter and absorption. This measurement is called a xial light l oss.
