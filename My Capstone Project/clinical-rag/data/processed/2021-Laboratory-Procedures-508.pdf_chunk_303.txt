When additional urine is obtained or collected  and it is enough to fill the SP’ s profile , pool the urine 
into the most recently collected cup (the cup with the highest urine collection instance number on the cup label), mix, and process. Do not enter a result until urine arrives in the laboratory. At the end of each session, review the results for each SP. Enter “ No” in the result field for all SPs who 
have not produced a urine sample. Record a result other than “none” for all SPs.  If the second urine 
sample is a full cup, mix equal parts of the first and second collections to fill the vessels in the profile.
