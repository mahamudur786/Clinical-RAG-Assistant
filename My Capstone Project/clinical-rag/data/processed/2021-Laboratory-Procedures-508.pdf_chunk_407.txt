verified prior to delivery and transfer to the analytical modules within the system. The 
SAM design provides for two methods of sample delivery: sample segmentation and 
sample dispensing. In sample segmentation, aspirated sample is transferred through the 
Blood Sample Valve where it is segmented for whole blood CBC and body fluid. In 
sample dispensing, whole blood sample segments are dispensed via the aspiration probe 
into the mixing chambers on the AMTC for the WBC differential and NRBC analyses.  
• VCSn Module . The VCSn module provides the physical processing elements necessary 
for the differential and NRBC sample preparation and subsequent measurement. This module includes the Distribution Valve (DV), AMTC module, MTM and their
