Testing, and External QC  
A Beckman Coulter technical representative performs DxH 800 instrument setup and verification 
and performs and verifies QC checks according to their procedure at the beginning of each stand. Clinical laboratory scientists  perform instrument calibration, precision analysis, and a repeatability 
evaluation . 
The laboratory participates in proficiency testing programs administered by an outside scientific group to be sure on a periodic basis that accuracy and precision are within acceptable limits. The
