x Assessment of the direction of air movement can be done easily using smoke 
tubes, strips of ribbon, or by observing the directionality of dense smoke from “dhoop” or incense stick.
x Directional control of airﬂ  ow can be achieved in mixed mode ventilation by 
paying proper attention to adequate exhaust and supply ventilation.
