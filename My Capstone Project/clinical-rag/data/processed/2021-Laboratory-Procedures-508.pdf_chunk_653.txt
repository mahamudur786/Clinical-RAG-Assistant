hemoglobin exceeds 200 mg/L.  
Icteric  There is visible orange color to the serum or plasma. “Icteric ” refers to 
orange color imparted to a sample because of the presence of bilirubin. Bilirubin present in serum results in  a visible “jaundice ” color when the 
concentration of bilirubin is above 430 umol/L. 
Lipemic  There is turbid appearance to the serum or plasma. “Lipemia ” refers to 
the presence of lipid particles (usually  very low -density lipoprotein) in a 
sample, which gives the sample a turbid appearance. Plasma appears 
visibly lactescent or lipemic when the concentration of triglycerides 
exceeds 4.6 mmol/L .
