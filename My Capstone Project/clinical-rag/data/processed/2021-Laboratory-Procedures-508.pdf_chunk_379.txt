When SPs return  a second  day for completion of a n exam (e.g., the DXA  machine was down for a 
session ), they  must submit another urine sample to confirm a negative pregnancy test on the day of 
the partial exam . In these cases  a second urine pregnancy test will appear on the heads up for the 
repeat visit. Laboratory staff  will perform the urine pregnancy test, then send a message to the 
coordinator to appropriately assign the SP to pertinent component exams. Should the result of the 
second visit pregnancy test be positive, a UFO will be submitted in addition to notifying the clinician and the coordinator. The SP will not be assigned to any component where this is an 
exclusion.
