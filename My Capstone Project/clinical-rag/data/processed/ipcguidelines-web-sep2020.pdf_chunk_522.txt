clothes, linen, guard rails, over-bed tables, blood pressure cuffs, the ﬂ  oor, and

x Environmental contamination with MDRO can contaminate HCWs’ hands 
during patient care.
x Patients can also acquire MDRO when placed in a room previously occupied 
by a MDRO colonized patient due to environmental contamination.
x Frequently touched items in the emergency department such as computer 
keyboards, telephones, and door handles, stethoscopes are frequently contaminated and have the potential to transmit the contaminating MDRO, and should be routinely disinfected.
x Non-critical* equipment (e.g. blood pressure cuffs) and environmental surfaces 
(e.g. bed rails, patient furniture, ﬂ  oors) should be routinely cleaned and 
disinfected.
