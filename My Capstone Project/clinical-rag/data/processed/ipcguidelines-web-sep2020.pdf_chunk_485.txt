Prevalence survey
HCFs that have not started outcome surveillance, have limited resources and do 
not have any data on HAI rates in their facility, can undertake a prevalence survey. The staff carrying out the prevalence survey should be trained to identify existing cases of HAIs based on signs and symptoms of infection and simpliﬁ  ed surveillance 
criteria.
