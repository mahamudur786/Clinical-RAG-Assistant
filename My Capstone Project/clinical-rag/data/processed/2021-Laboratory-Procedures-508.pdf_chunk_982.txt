includes replacement of high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters as necessary.  
The basic concept of the LFBSC is to take air through a blower system, pressurize a plenum, and force air through a filter. Built -in supply and exhaust blowers come with separate HEPA filters. The  
recirculating airflow pattern directs a portion of the HEPA filtered air straigh t down over the central 
work area driving the airborne contaminants into the surrounding grills, allowing a pollution- free 
environment for particular specifications. If a filter is defective, the filtration system no longer filters and becomes a vacuum cle aner, taking in gross contamination and exploding it through the defective
