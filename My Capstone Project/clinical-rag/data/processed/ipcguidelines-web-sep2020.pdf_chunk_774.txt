12. The occupier or operator of a common biomedical waste incinerator shall use combustion 
gas analyser to measure CO
2, CO and O2.
2. Operating and emission standards for disposal by plasma 
pyrolysis or gasiﬁ  cation
A. Operating standards
All the operators of the plasma pyrolysis or gasiﬁ  cation shall meet the following operating 
and emission standards:1. Combustion Efﬁ  ciency (CE) shall be at least 99.99%.
2. The combustion efﬁ  ciency is computed as follows:
     (%CO
2)C.E. =  x 100
   (% CO2 + %CO)
3. The temperature of the combustion chamber after plasma gasiﬁ  cation shall be 1050±50 °C 
with gas residence time of at least 2 (two) second, with minimum 3% oxygen in the stack gas.
4. The stack height should be a minimum of 30 m above ground level and shall be attached
