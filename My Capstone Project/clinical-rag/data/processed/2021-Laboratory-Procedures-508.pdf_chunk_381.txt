test step for all specimens and controls at timed intervals before proceeding to the next test step. It is recommended that no more than 10 test devices be run in one batch. 
• Specim ens Containing Particulate Matter . Urine samples exhibiting visible 
precipitates should be allowed to settle to obtain a clear sample for testing.  
• Very dilute urine s amples , as indicated by a low specific gravity, may not contain 
representative levels of h CG. 
• False negative r esults  may occur when the levels of hCG are below the sensitivity 
level of the test.  
• Very low l evels of hCG  (less than 50 mIU/mL) are present in urine samples shortly
