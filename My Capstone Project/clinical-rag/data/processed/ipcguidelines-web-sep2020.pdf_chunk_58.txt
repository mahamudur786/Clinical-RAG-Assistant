Healthcare-associated infection (HAI), previously referred to as “nosocomial” or 
“hospital” infection, occurs in a patient during the process of care in a hospital or other healthcare facility (HCF), but was not present or incubating at the time of admission. HAIs include occupational infections among healthcare providers. 
HAIs are one of the most common adverse events during healthcare delivery 
and a major public health issue affecting morbidity, mortality and quality of life. At any time, up to 7% of patients in developed and 10% in developing countries will acquire at least one HAI,
1 causing a considerable economic burden to the society. 
However, HAIs are largely preventable through effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.
