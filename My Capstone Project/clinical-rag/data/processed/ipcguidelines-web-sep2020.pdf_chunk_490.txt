Laboratory reports are necessary for the diagnosis of UTI, BSI and MDRO 
surveillance.

x Demographic details and risk factors: age, gender, severity of underlying 
illness, diabetes and any primary diagnosis, indwelling devices, operative procedure, other treatments such as chemotherapy, date, type of HAI event, microorganisms isolated and antimicrobial susceptibility.
