Violation across the run indicates that only a single portion of the analytical curve is affected 
by the error. The control run is rejected when two  consecutive control measurements are 
greater than 2  SDs of control limit s on the same side of mean within or across the run, with 
this rule.

Exhibit 6 -7. Westgard Rule 4s 
 Rule 4S. This rule rejects a run if there is at least a 4 SD difference between control values 
within a single run. For example, Level 1 control is + 2.9 SD above the mean and Level 2 
is -1.4 SD below the mean. The total difference between the two control levels is greater than 
4 SD. This ru le identifies random error and is applied only within the current run.
