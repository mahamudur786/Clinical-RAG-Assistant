testing can have the following fallacies. A negative culture may mean that:
x the right samples may not have been collected;
x the methodologies may not be standardized (there may be overgrowth of 
other organisms, some samples require neutralization steps to get rid of disinfectants, etc.); 
x even using the best methods, the yield can still be low;
x the organism may have been present but is not there now;
x environmental pathogens may have adapted to low nutrition environments and 
need special media to grow; 
x there may be limited bacterial yield in getting the bacteria off the surface onto 
the swab; and
x there may be limited yield getting the bacteria off the swab into the media.
