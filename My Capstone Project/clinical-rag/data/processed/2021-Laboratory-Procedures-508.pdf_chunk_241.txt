3.11 Hand Venipuncture  
It is acceptable to  use dorsal hand veins as the venipuncture site. This site should be used only if the 
antecubital veins are unsuitable, such as when the antecubital area is edematous, burned , or scarred, 
there are casts on both arms, or the veins are thrombosed. 
• With glov ed hand,  select a vein that is palpable, by lightly brushing a finger across the 
back of the hand as it is palpated. This helps select the best vein and determines its 
direction. Palpate even when the vein is visible.  
• Use a 21 -gauge or 23 -gauge butterfly b lood collection set, depending on the condition 
of the SP’ s veins.  
• Follow the venipuncture technique described in Section 3.9.3 to draw the blood.
