Transmission-based precautions
These precautions for aseptic techniques and device management for clinical 
procedures are applied in addition to standard precautions, depending upon the epidemiology and route of transmission of the agent/ disease. These precautions are relevant to high-risk procedures (e.g. use of indwelling catheters and other devices, surgery, and other invasive procedures) and special settings (e.g. OTs, ICUs, neonatal wards, haemodialysis units and central reprocessing units). The following modes of transmission and appropriate transmission-based precautions should be adopted in HCFs (see Annex 7).
