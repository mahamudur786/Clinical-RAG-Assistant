Cooperation. Gaining the cooperation of an SP is easier if the atmosphere in the phlebotomy room is pleasant and makes the SP feel comfortable. Below is a list of suggestions for creating a pleasant atmosphere in the phlebotomy room. 
• Maintain a clean and uncluttered work area. This is especially important because of 
today’s concern with blood-borne infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. 
• Be aware of body image; a positive body image  shows  confidence and helps instill trust 
with the SP . Maintain a tidy appearance, erect posture, and a smile.
