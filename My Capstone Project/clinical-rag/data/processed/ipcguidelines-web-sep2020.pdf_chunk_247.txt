x The implication of installing a split air-conditioning and closing the doors and 
windows is, however, complete lack of air exchange.

Minimum air-changes per hour
HCFs should maintain a minimum amount of ventilation during all climatic conditions. These recommendations are based on the minimum ventilation rate estimated to reduce the probability of infection in an enclosed room to less than 5% with an hour of exposure to an infectious source case. 
Table 5.2 gives the minimum air-changes per hour (ACH) required for various 
healthcare settings.
