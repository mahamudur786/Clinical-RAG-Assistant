genital or urinary tracts are entered under controlled conditions and without unusual contamination. Speciﬁ  cally, operations involving the biliary tract, 
appendix, vagina and oropharynx are included in this category, provided no evidence of infection or major break in technique is encountered. 
Class III Contaminated Open, fresh, accidental wounds. In addition, operations 
with major breaks in sterile technique (for example, open cardiac massage) or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract, and incisions in which acute, non-purulent inﬂ  ammation is encountered, including necrotic
