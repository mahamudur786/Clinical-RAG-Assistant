Calculation of incidence
BSI rate (BSI per 1000 patient-days): divide the total number of reported BSI by the 
number of patient-days and then multiply by 1000.
CLABSI rate (CLABSI per 1000 central line days): divide the total number of reported 
CLABSI by the number of central line days and then multiply by 1000.
Device utilization rates: the device utilization rates for central lines and ventilators 
are calculated by dividing the number of days of device use by the number of patient-days.Box 7.3. Rules for two matching blood cultures
