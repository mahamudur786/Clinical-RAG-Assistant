by the control manufacturer. Coulter’ s Hematology Interlaboratory Quality Assurance 
Program (IQAP) pr ovides useful measures of the means and SDs observed in other 
laboratories using the Coulter DxH 800. 
• At the start of a stand, use the manufacturer control published mean and SD until 20 
runs have been performed on the control. After the 20 runs are completed, follow the 
steps below to establish the instrument- specific mean and SD for each level of the 
control. 
• Procedure for establishing means and standard deviation (SD) requirements:  
– Analyze the new control a minimum of 20 times across multiple days. Testing 
conditions should mimic routine testing as closely as possible.
