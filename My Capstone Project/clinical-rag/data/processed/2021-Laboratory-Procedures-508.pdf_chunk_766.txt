9.2.1 Introduction  
The goal of specimen submission and handling is to optimize the accurate and reliable measurement 
of analytes of interest. Each analytical procedure used in NHANES is documented in the Laboratory Proced ure Manual ( LPM) . Eac h method in the LPM specifies the procedure to be used 
for preparation of the study participant (SP), specimen collection, labeling, processing, and 
preservation, as well as conditions for appropriate specimen transport. The methods may refer to 
the NHANES  blood collection protocol or urine collection protocol, noting any special 
requirements. These protocols are a starting point due to the special contamination requirements needed for collection of specimens analyzed for metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
