• Calibration.  Defined by CLIA as “the process of testing and adjusting an instrument, 
kit, or test system to provide a known relationship between the measurement response and the value of the substance that is being measured by the test procedure.” 
• Calibration Material.  Defined by CLIA as “a solution which has a known amount of 
analyte weighed in or has a value determined by repetitive testing using a reference or definitive test method. ” Many standards are therefore calibration materials.  
• Calibration Verification. Defined by CLIA as “the assaying of calibration materials in 
the same manner as survey participant samples to confirm that the calibration of the 
instrument, kit, or test system has remained stable throughout the laboratory’ s
