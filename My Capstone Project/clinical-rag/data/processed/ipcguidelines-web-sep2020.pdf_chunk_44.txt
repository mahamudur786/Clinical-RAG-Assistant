2005, focused on improving hand hygiene. It is also closely aligned to and can be integrated under the Government’s Swachh Bharat Mission. Vaccines and the use of reuse prevention (RUP) syringes are other methods than can avert infections.
Infection control nurses are the frontline workers for IPC. WHO has designated 2020 
as the “Year of the Nurse and Midwife”, in honour of the 200th birth anniversary of Florence Nightingale. Nurses play an important role in the care of patients and preventing healthcare-associated infections, which includes educating the patients and their families, ensuring hand hygiene and supporting antimicrobial stewardship.
I look forward to these new guidelines being implemented in all healthcare facilities.
