Transplant recipients are at increased risk of HAIs, which can occur due to 
inadequate engineering controls, improper systems or procedures, breaks in established procedures, lack of monitoring for known contaminants, or inadequately trained and educated staff. In addition to other HAIs, intra-abdominal infection may

occur among liver, small bowel, or other visceral transplant recipients.

practices is an essential requirement for the transplant unit. The unit should have knowledgeable, well-trained staff that understands the implications of deviating from established infection control procedures.
