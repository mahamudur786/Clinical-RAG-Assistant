centre of the waste pile. The occupier or operator shall conduct this test three consecutive times to deﬁ  ne the minimum operating conditions. The temperature, pressure and residence 
time at which all biological indicator vials or strips for three consecutive tests show complete inactivation of the spores shall deﬁ  ne the minimum operating conditions for the autoclave. 
After determining the minimum temperature, pressure and residence time, the occupier or operator of a common biomedical waste treatment facility shall conduct this test once in three months and records in this regard shall be maintained.
6. Routine test: A chemical indicator strip or tape that changes colour when a certain 
temperature is reached can be used to verify that a speciﬁ  c temperature has been achieved.
