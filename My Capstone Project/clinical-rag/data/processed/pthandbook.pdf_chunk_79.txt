decisions that reflect your values and beliefs. 
Bioethicists participate on review boards that 
review all research studies involving patients 
at the Clinical Center, to ensure that they meet 
the ethical standards. 
During your stay, you will make many 
decisions about your care and participatio n in 
research . 
These decisions may be hard to make. The 
bioethic s consultation service , with member s 
from both the Clinica l Center' s ethic s 
committee and the Department of Bioethics

your need s with those of other s and make 
decisions that are best for you.

my value s about life and the future ?
