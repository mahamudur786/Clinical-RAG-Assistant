soon as possible. 
• Place the tube in the centrifuge carrier of either tabletop centrifuge. Balance the tube in
the centrifuge by using water- filled tubes if necessary. Centrifuge the 2  mL gray tube at
2-8°C and 2,900 rpm for 10 minutes to yield plasma for  vessel 9 ( glucose).
Important Note:  If the 2  mL gray top tube cannot be separated and processed 
immediately  after mixing, the tube will be refrigerated until it can be separated and 
processed.

• Use a  3.5 mL  disposable plastic transfer pipette to transfer at least  0.5 mL  plasma from
this tube for vessel 9 (glucose) on primary SPs aged 12+ years into a 2 mL  vessel.
– Determine if the plasma is hemolyzed, turbid, lipemic, or icteric. If so, enter a
