2. Tap the area lightly  with the index and second finger two or three times to cause 
the veins to dilate. 
3. Allow the arm to hang at the SP’ s side without a tourniquet to allow the veins to 
fill to their capacity.  
4. Examine the SP ’s other arm; sometimes the veins in one arm are larger than in the 
other. 
5. Check carefully for scar tissue or tendons near the vein.

Apply the tourniquet for no more than 1 minute while searching for a vein and then release the 
tourniquet for 2 to 3 minutes. Avoid prolonged obstruction of blood flow by the tourniquet because it is uncomfortable for the SP and may alter certain results (e.g., cholesterol).  
• Reapply the tourniquet when ready to perform the venipuncture.
