Droplet transmission occurs through large respiratory droplets >5 microns in size. Transmission occurs when infectious respiratory droplets are expelled by coughing, sneezing or talking, and come into contact with another person’s mucosa (eyes, nose or mouth), either directly or via contaminated hands.
