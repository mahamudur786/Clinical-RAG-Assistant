gradual deterioration of the calibration. A change in the mean may be sudden and demonstrated as a 
shift in control values. Factors that contribute to systematic error are independent of the analyte concentration. Examples of these factors include change in reagent lot, major instrument maintenance, change in room temperature or humidity, failure in the sampling system, or inaccurate 
calibration. 
Exhibit 9- 1 presents examples of shifts and trends in QC data.
