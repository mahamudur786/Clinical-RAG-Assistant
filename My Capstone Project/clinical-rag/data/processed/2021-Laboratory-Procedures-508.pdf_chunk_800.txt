Laboratory Component Lead, who uploads the data in the Beckman Coulter IQAP system and 
compares the results to those from other laboratories. Beckman Coulter issues a report that contains a statistical analysis to evaluate performance. The laboratory staff perform this procedure at the end 
of each stand, using procedures described in Chapter 6.
