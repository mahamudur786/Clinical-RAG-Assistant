Infectious diarrhoea is conﬁ  rmed when a bacterial or viral aetiology is demonstrated. 
Diarrhoea may also occur due to non-infectious causes such as medications. In many cases the cause of diarrhoea cannot be diagnosed (for deﬁ  nition criteria, see 
Chapter 7).
The infection is transmitted through the faeco-oral route. It may be acquired from 
contaminated food or water, infected patients or staff, contact with environment contaminated with organisms or instruments entering the alimentary tract such as endoscopes. Box 2.4 gives some common organisms that cause gastrointestinal infections.
Healthcare-associated diarrhoea often presents as an outbreak. The index case 
or asymptomatic carrier introduces the infection in the ward which then leads to person-to-person spread.
