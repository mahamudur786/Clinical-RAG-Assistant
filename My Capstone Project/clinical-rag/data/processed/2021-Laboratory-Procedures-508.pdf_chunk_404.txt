• Weight (mass) of Hgb determined from the degree of absorbance found through photo current transmittance expressed in g/ dl. 
• Corrected for WBC int erference.  
• Hgb (g/dl) = [constant X log
10 (Reference %T/Sample %T)].  
Hct Calculated  Hematocrit  
• The relative volume of packed erythrocytes to whole blood.  
• Hct (%) = RBC X MCVV10. 
MCV  Derived from 
RBC 
Histogram  Mean Corpuscular Volume  
• The average volume of  individual erythrocytes derived from the RBC 
histogram. 
• The system multiples the number of RBC in each channel by the size of the RBC in that channel. The products of each channel between 36 and 360 femtoliters (fL) are added. This sum is divided 
by the total number of RBC between 36 and 360 fL. The a nalyzer 
then multiplies by a calibration factor.
