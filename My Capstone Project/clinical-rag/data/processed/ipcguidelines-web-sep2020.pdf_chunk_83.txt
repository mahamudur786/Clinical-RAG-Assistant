It is deﬁ  ned as a lower respiratory tract infection that appears during or after 
hospitalization of a patient who was not incubating the infection on admission.The diagnostic criteria are:
x Fever;
x Cough with purulent sputum;
x New inﬁ  ltrate on radiology; and
x Gram-staining of sputum/endotracheal (ET) aspirate and bacteria.
Healthcare-associated pneumonia is acquired by the inhalation of respiratory 
droplets or aerosols, or aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal and gastric secretions in conditions of low gastric acidity. Infection can also be acquired through the oropharynx during suction procedures, due to inadequate handwashing and inappropriate disinfection of respiratory devices.
