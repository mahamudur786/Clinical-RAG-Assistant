SPEED  
 I ndicates rotor speed in revolutions per minute (rpm)  or in relative centrifugal 
field, a term describing the ratio of the centrifugal acceleration at a specified 
radius and speed to the standard acceleration of gravity (RCF x g).  
TIME  
 I n a timed run, indicates the remaining run time in hours and minutes. The time
