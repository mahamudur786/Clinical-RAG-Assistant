*According to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), 30–90 days are taken as 
the duration after surgical operation for the detection of deep incisional and organ space SSI. This is dependent upon the type of operative procedure. The NHSN list of operative procedures for which either a 30-day or 90-day duration is considered for detection of SSI is given in Annex 13.5.
The criteria required to diagnose infection have to be uniform to accurately identify 
any increase or decrease in infection. Correct identiﬁ  cation of SSI helps us to ﬁ  nd 
out if an intervention to reduce the occurrence of SSI is effective. Uniformity also assists in comparing SSI rates between facilities (Box 7.1).
