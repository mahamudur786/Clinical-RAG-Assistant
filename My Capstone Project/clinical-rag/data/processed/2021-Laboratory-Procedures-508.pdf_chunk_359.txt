• Place the test device on a clean and level surface. Hold the dropper vertically and 
transfer three full drops of urine (approximately 100 µL) to the sample well (S) of  the 
test device, and then start the timer. Avoid trapping air bubbles in the sample well. 
• Wait for the red line(s) to appear. Read the results at 3 minutes when testing a urine 
sample. It is important that the background is clear before the result is read.

extended period; therefore, do not interpret the result after 3 minutes when testing a urine sample.
