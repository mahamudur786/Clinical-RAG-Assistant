the venipuncture protocol as displayed in ISIS. If an SP exhibits nervousness, block the 
tubes from their view, if possible.  
• Instruct the SP to sit  in the phl ebotomy chair. Never  attempt a venipuncture on a 
standing SP . Having the SP  sit helps guard against any injury that might result if the SP  
faints. Place the SP in a supine position if  it is impossible for them to sit upright during 
the procedure. Instruct the SP to extend the ir arm pal m up and straight at the elbow. If 
the SP is a child or infant, have a clinical labor atory scientist  hold the SP in the proper 
position. 
• Position the SP’ s arm on the armrest or a pillow so that the veins are readily accessible
