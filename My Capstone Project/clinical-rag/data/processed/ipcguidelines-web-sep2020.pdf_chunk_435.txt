response. Some hospitals may be designated by the health authorities to receive only suspected or conﬁ  rmed cases of an epidemic disease. 
x Implement IPC measures.  Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent 
the spread of infection to hospital staff, patients and visitors. The HICC and the hospital management should review and, if required, revise the hospital’s IPC protocols. Additional prevention and control measures may be required to cope with the speciﬁ  c nature of an epidemic (see Annex 2).
An effective infection control programme and the ability of an HCF to implement 
appropriate IPC measures in normal, routine circumstances will strengthen the HCF’s capacity to put them into practice during an epidemic situation.
