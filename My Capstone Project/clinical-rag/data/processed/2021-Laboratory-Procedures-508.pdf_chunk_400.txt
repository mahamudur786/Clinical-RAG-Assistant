light scatter and absorption. This measurement is called a xial light l oss. 
6.2.3  Dataplot Development  
The technician performs a series of operations on the stored digital raw values received from the 
flow cell to identify populations and calculate the frequency of cells within each population. The system produces the dataplot displays for visual representation of the differential, NRBC  
membership (types of cells), and density (concentration). 
The DxH 800 sy stem algorithm uses tools designed for finding optimal separation between 
overlapping clusters of data. The algorithm can: 
• Adapt to unusual population shifts and overlaps; 
• Define highly irregular separation; 
• Make subsequent analysis of the identified regions; and 
• Correct deficiencies in  separation.
