Some shipments require a coolant to keep the specimens cold but not frozen during shipment. For 
these shipments, use reusable refrigerant packs. Add enough frozen refrigerant packs to the shipper to keep specimens cold for at least 48 -72 hours. Keep approximately  24 refrigerant packs in the 
freezers at all times, replacing as necessary. Pack all refrigerated containers in Styrofoam shippers.  
Pack the specimen storage boxes tightly in the Styrofoam container to prevent movement.  
• Seal the 9 x 12 zip -closable plastic bag or the pressure vessel containing the boxes. 
• Place at least two frozen refrigerant packs in the bottom of a shipper.  
• Add a layer of crumpled newsprint. 
• Place the pressure vessel containing the boxes on top of the newsprint.
