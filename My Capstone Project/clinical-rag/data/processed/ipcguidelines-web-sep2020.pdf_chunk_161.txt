1. Hand hygiene
The WHO guidelines on hand hygiene in healthcare (2009) suggest that42 hand 
hygiene is the single most important measure for prevention of infection. Hands can become contaminated with infectious agents through contact with a patient, patient surroundings, the environment, or other HCWs. Hand hygiene removes dust/soil, organic material and transient microorganisms from the skin and reduces the risk of cross-contamination. Evidence suggests that the hands of HCWs are the most common vehicle for the transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens from patient to patient and within the healthcare environment (Box 4.1). Studies show a direct correlation between an increase in adherence to hand hygiene with decrease in HAIs.
