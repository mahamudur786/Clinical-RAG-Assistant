5-1  Laboratory Procedures 2021   
The assay is conducted by adding urine to the sample well of the test device. The sample migrates 
via capillary action along the membrane to react with colored conjugate. Positive samples react with the specific antibody-hCG-colored conjugate to form a colored line at the test region of the 
membrane. Absence of this colored line suggests a negative result. To serve as a procedural control, 
a colored line will always appear at the control line region if the test has been performed properly.
