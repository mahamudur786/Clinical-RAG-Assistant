xiv National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are one of the most 
common complications of healthcare management. These are serious health hazards as many are caused by serious antibiotic-resistant bacteria leading to increase in the length of hospital stay and the associated costs, and may even lead to death.
Healthcare facilities are high-risk environments for the 
development and spread of drug resistance and frequently have the highest burden of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and practices reduce the opportunities for resistant pathogens to spread in healthcare facilities. They are therefore important in our efforts to contain antimicrobial resistance.
