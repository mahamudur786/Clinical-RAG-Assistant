Elements of a case deﬁ  nition include:
x Clinical criteria (signs and symptoms)
x Person, place and time criteria
x Laboratory test
Classiﬁ  cation of a case deﬁ  nition:126
x The suspected case.  A patient with compatible clinical symptoms, but maybe 
not all symptoms, and a likely epidemiological link has not yet been conﬁ  rmed. 
x The probable case.  This means that the clinical symptoms and epidemiology 
are compatible with the case deﬁ  nition.
x A conﬁ  rmed case.  This is the strongest level of certainty. A suspected 
or probable case who has had a positive laboratory test for the disease. Laboratory conﬁ  rmation may not always be possible and often unavailable 
early on in an investigation.
