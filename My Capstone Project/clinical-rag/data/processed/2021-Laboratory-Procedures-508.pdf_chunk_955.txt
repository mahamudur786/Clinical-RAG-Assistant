TIME  
 I n a timed run, indicates the remaining run time in hours and minutes. The time 
display begins counting down when ENTER/SAVE and then START are pressed 
and continues counting down to 0. The run automatically ends when the set time 
reaches 0 and deceleration begins (a tone sounds wh en the rotor stops spinning). 
If a malfunction shuts down the centrifuge during a run, when the instrument is turned back on the time will not remain and 00:00 will be displayed in the time 
window. By comparing this time with the original set time, you can  determine 
when the run ended.  
TEMPERATURE   
 I ndicates rotor temperature in degrees C at thermoequilibrium.
