x if an aerosol-generating procedure such as bronchoscopy is performed on a 
patient with active TB; and
x if a particulate respirator is not available, whenever possible, avoid 
performance of aerosol-generating procedures associated with an increased risk of transmission of pathogens in patients with acute respiratory infections.
Training
Ensure that users of particulate respirators receive training on: 
x How to put on a particulate respirator (e.g. N95 respirator);
x The need to perform the seal check every time the respirator is worn;
x Avoiding contamination during use, and removing and disposing of the 
respirator; and
x Changing the mask immediately if the respirator gets wet or dirty with 
secretions.
