UWBC  Coulter Principle  Uncorrected White Blood Cell  
• Measure directly, multiplied by the calibration factor.  
• UWBC = N x 10
3 cells/ µL. 
RBC Coulter 
Principle  Red Blood Cell Count or Erythrocyte Count  
• Measure directly, multiplied by the calibration factor.  
• Correct ed for very high white count if necessary.  
• RBC = N X 106 cells/ µL. 
Hgb Photometric 
Measurement  Hemoglobin or Hemoglobin Concentration 
• Transmittance of light at 525 nm through a lysed WBC solution in 
the Hgb cuvette, compared to the transmittance of the same light 
through a reagent blank. The system converts this ratio to the Hgb 
value using a calibration factor.  
• Weight (mass) of Hgb determined from the degree of absorbance found through photo current transmittance expressed in g/ dl.
