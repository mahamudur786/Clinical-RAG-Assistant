x Bathing or washing the neonate should be done once the temperature of the 
neonate has stabilized (usually by 6 hours of birth). The perineal area and buttocks should be kept clean, by washing with a soft cloth, cotton swabs soaked in warm water after every diaper change using fresh swabs and a separate bowl for each wash occasion. Perform hand hygiene before and after diaper change.
