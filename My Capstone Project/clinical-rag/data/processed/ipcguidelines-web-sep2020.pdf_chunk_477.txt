Safety centrifuge cups
These are enclosed containers designed to prevent aerosols from being released 
during centrifugation. 
Decontamination
Steam autoclaving is the preferred method for all decontamination processes. Materials for decontamination and disposal should be placed in containers, e.g. autoclavable plastic bags that are colour-coded according to the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 (amended 2018, 2019). 
Handling laboratory waste
A well-managed and monitored biomedical waste management system must be in place in the laboratory in accordance with the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 (amended 2018, 2019).
