Standard precautions are the basics of IPC and should be observed in all health 
facilities. Hand hygiene, especially handwashing, is one of the simplest and cost-effective interventions to prevent infections and combat antimicrobial resistance.
Surveillance of HAI is important to assess the burden, monitor trends and develop 
evidence-based polices to address AMR and patient safety. Digital health and IT solutions to monitor the trends of HAI through the Integrated Health Information Portal of MoHFW will be one of our targets. Creating awareness about infections, controlling antimicrobial resistance and ensuring access to safe healthcare will need that these guidelines be implemented in letter and spirit across all healthcare facilities.
