greater than  35 fl in size.  
– Elevated WBC counts may have a carryover effect on subsequent leukopenic 
specimens,  within the limits specified by Beckman Coulter. (See the Carryover 
section in the Unicel DxH Help Manual  on board the analyzer.)  
• RBC  
– Very high WBC count, hi gh concentration of very large platelets, auto - 
agglutination. 
– If hemolysis is occurring in vivo, the instrument RBC may be flagged as low, reflecting the true circulating cells. If , however, the hemolysis is in vitro, the 
specimen may give falsely low RBC results. Cell counts due to in vitro hemolysis 
do not represent the number of circulating red blood cells. 
• HGB  – severe lipemia, heparin, certain unusual RBC abnormalities that resi st lysing.
