Possible  causes of abnormal parameters:  
• High RBC, Hgb, or HCT—dehydration, polycythemia, shock, chronic hypoxia; 
• Low RBC, Hgb, or HCT—anemia, thalassemia, and other hemoglobinopathies; 
• Low MCV —microcytic anemia; 
• High MCV—macrocytic anemia, liver disease ; 
• Low WBC —sepsis, marrow hypoplasia; 
• High WBC—acute stress, infection, malignancies ; 
• Low platelets —risk of bleeding; and 
• High platele ts—risk of thrombosis.
