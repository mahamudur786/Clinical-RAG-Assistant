cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), heart conditions, eye problems, dental issues, 
depression, and nerve diseases, to name just a few. For all of the studies, the CC provides the resources 
required to implement safe, cutting -edge clinical research, and ensure the best achievable patient
