deliver ing closed -vial and open- vial specimens , which  accommodates  a wide range of 
specimen tubes. The STM supports the following: 
– Operator loading and unloading of specimens; 
– Transport and queuing of specimens; 
– Mixing and presentation of specimens; and 
– A magnetic transport s ystem to move cassettes containing specimens.  
• Sample Aspiration Module (SAM).  The SAM aspirates from capped specimen tubes 
(presented via cassette or single -tube presentation) or open vials (single-tube 
presentation). Body fluids are presented via single-tube, while whole bloods can be 
presented in either presentation mode. The identification and integrity of samples are 
verified prior to delivery and transfer to the analytical modules within the system. The
