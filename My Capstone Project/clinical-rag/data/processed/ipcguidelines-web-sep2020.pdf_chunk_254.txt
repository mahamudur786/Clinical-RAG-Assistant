Directional control of air ﬂ  ow
x Directional control of air ﬂ  ow is recommended in speciﬁ  c high-risk settings 
where infectious patients with drug-resistant TB or other acute respiratory diseases of potential concern are likely to be managed – i.e. airborne precaution rooms, MDR-TB wards and clinics, and bronchoscopy suites. 
x There should be a system in place for minimizing the chance of airﬂ  ow from the 
room to other parts of the facility. In a room relying on natural ventilation that is situated away from other patient care areas, no additional changes would be required. However, it would be important to keep the doors to the corridor or other rooms closed, to prevent the escape of infectious aerosols to other parts of the facility.
