Airborne transmission
Airborne dissemination may occur via particles containing infectious agents that 
remain suspended in air over time and distance. Small-particle aerosols (<5 microns) are created during breathing, talking, coughing or sneezing and secondarily by evaporation of larger droplets in conditions of low humidity. 
Certain procedures, particularly those that induce coughing, can promote airborne 
transmission. These include diagnostic sputum induction, bronchoscopy, airway suctioning, endotracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation via facemask and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.
