air currents as well as interfere with the work of the operator. A person walking past the front of a 
cabinet can cause  draft velocities up to 175 fp m (.89 m/s), which are sufficient to disrupt the air 
balance of the laminar flow unit.  
1.2.4 Use  Unidirectional Air Flow  
The operator must keep two important facts in mind: (1 ) the air, as supplied to the work area 
through filters from the top, is contaminant free and (2) airborne contamination generated in the work area is controlled by the unidirectional flow of parallel air streams in a top -to-bottom direction. 
A solid object placed in a laminar air stream will disrupt the parallel flow and consequently, the 
capability of controlling lateral movement of airborne particulates. A cone of turbulence extends
