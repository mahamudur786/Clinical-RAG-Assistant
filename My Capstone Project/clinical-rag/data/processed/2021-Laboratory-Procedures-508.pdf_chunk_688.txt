8.3.2 Main Printing Screen 
From the main printing screen, the current day and next 2 days the MEC is in session will be displayed in a tree view on the left side of the screen.  See Exhibit 8- 3. The sessions will be color 
coded to match the legend at the bottom left side of the screen. Sessions in green indicate that a particular session or SPs profile  within that session needs to be printed. Sessions in black have 
already been printed and there are no SP profile changes. Sessions in blue indicate that an SP was added to that session or that a SP or SPs had a profile change and need to be reprinted. If an SP is 
removed from a session, that session will be displayed in red, which indicates label ac tion is needed.
