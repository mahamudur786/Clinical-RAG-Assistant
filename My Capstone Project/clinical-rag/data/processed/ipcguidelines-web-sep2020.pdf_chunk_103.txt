In 2016, WHO issued evidence-based guidelines incorporated in an implementation 
manual on the core components of IPC. The ﬁ  rst step towards implementation is

Objectives of the IPC programme
The objective is to minimize the risk of HAIs to patients, HCWs and visitors. This is achieved by:
x enabling and assisting all categories of HCWs to adhere to comprehensive IPC 
practices at all levels of care; and
x providing safe and quality healthcare and improving outcomes by reducing 
morbidity and mortality.
