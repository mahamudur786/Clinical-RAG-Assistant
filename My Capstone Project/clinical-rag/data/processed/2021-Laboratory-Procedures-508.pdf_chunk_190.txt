Q2. Have you had any of the following since (time from question 1 inserted here)? 
Coffee or tea with cream or 
sugar? [I nclude milk or non -
dairy creamers.]  Black coffee is acceptable , but coffee with any additives other than 
artificial sweeteners is unacceptable. Include all milk products such as 
half-and-half, light cream, nonfat milk, and all other nondairy creamers 
like Cremora or Coffee-Mate. If “Yes”…correct fasting time.  
Alcohol, such as beer, wine, or 
liquor?  Alcohol includes all types of spirits including light beer and wine. If the answer is “ Yes,” clarify the response. Ask the SP to describe the activity, 
item con sumed, and the correct time.  If “Yes”…correct fasting time.
