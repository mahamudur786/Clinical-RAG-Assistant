session, and their exit. The coordinator uses this system to direct the SP to the appropriate

coordinator monitors the exam component status using responses from examination stations. 
It is critical to assign SPs aged 12 years and older to phlebotomy as soon as possible at the start of a 
session  block , especially the  morning session blocks , as we ask the participants to fast for at least 8 
hours . The coordinator gives each SP a hard -copy verification form as part of the check -in process.
