Implementation strategies
WHO recommends a multimodal strategy for IPC activities to improve practices and 
reduce HAI and AMR.11 
The multimodal approach consists of three or more components implemented in an 
integrated way with the aim of improving outcomes (bundle approach), and includes tools (bundles and checklist) developed by multidisciplinary teams based on local conditions. An example of an effective multimodal strategy is one that has been shown to bring about signiﬁ  cant improvement in IPC practices and reduce the risk 
of HAI.
