11. Follow-up and communicate ﬁ  ndings
Many times, we may have to conduct a follow up or “deﬁ  nitive” investigation by 
reﬁ ning the case deﬁ  nition on initial ﬁ  ndings to make it possible to detect the real 
cases and continue surveillance efforts based on the reﬁ  ned case deﬁ  nition. If required, modify the preventive and control measures of your ﬁ  ndings from ongoing 
surveillance or follow-up investigation to provide better epidemiological evidence about source and mode of transmission.
