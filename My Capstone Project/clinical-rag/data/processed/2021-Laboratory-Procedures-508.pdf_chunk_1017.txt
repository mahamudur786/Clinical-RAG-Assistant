to the back of the scale.  
Locate the black AC adapter power cord taped to the counter. Place the round end in the round 
hole labeled “ Power ” on the back side of the scale. The LCD display on the front of the scale 
should say “O ff.” Remove the small, round, plastic cone protector from the top of the scale. Be sure 
to place the cone protector back into the blue carrying case so that it does not get lost. 
Remove the weigh pan from the case lid. Gently place the pan on top of the scale, being sure to 
align the notch on the bottom of the pan with the bump on the right side of the cone. The pan 
should fit snugly and not wobble around when properly seated.
