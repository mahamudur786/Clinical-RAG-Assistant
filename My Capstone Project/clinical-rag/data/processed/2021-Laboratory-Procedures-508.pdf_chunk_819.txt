for results of analyses of the calibration materials based on the method precision of these materials.  
The reliability of analytical values obtained when using a procedure often depends on the quality of 
the standards and the calibration procedure. The College of American Pathologists suggests that automated instruments be calibrated using multiple analytical whole blood specimens or a certified, 
stabilized whole-blood type preparation. The International Committee for Standardization of 
Hematology, by its definition, requires that a calibrator “ be based on or traceable to a reference 
preparation or material. ”
