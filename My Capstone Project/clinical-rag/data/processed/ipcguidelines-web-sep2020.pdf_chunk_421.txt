IPC in emergency care
The emergency department is a busy place subject to rapid patient turnover and overcrowding; half of all admissions to the hospital are from the emergency. The emergency department, such as the OPD, is also the frontline in the response to public health emergencies and disasters. Patients admitted through the emergency are sicker than those who report to the OPD.
Infection prevention is a major challenge in the emergency department due to the 
following:
89
x High-volume of patients, many needing rapid intervention
x Patients present with undifferentiated illnesses of various types and the 
condition ranges from the otherwise healthy to the critically ill.
