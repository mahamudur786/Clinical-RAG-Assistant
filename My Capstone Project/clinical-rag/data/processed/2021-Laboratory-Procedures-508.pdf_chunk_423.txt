• Coulter Latron CP- X control (store at 2 –30°C) is recommended for the verification of 
the system calibration status of the VCSn parameters. Coulter Latron CP -X control 
checks the alignment  of the laser and the flow cell on the DxH 800. 
– Perform daily checks prior to running Latron control. 
– Gently mix Latron CP -X control by inversion five to eight times. Avoid foaming. 
– Run the controls in the cassette presentation on the instrument. 
• Coulter S- CAL® Calibrator is traceable to reference methods and recommended for 
determining adjustment factors to ensure accurate SPM measurements of directly 
measured CBC parameters. Calibrator results should be monitored with Coulter 6C cell 
control.
