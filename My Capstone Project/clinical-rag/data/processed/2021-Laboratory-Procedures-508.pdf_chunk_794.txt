within NHANES. The linearity of the instrument is evaluated at least once a year.  
In addition to these systems, NHANES uses calibration materials at the beginning of each stand to 
standardize the three Beckman Coulter DxH  800 instruments and to provide additional objective 
evaluation of the quality of specimen analysis. S -CAL® is a calibration material as defined by CLIA 
(i.e., “a solution, which has a known amount of analyte or has a value determined by repetitive 
testing  using a reference or definitive test method ”) that is useful for monitoring method 
performance.
