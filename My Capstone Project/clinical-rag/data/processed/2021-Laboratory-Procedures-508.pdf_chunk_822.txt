temperature varies by more than 10 °F (5.5°C) from the room temperature during the last 
calibration. 
Instructions for the performance of calibration procedures using S- CAL calibration are in Chapter  6. 
9.6.10 Linearity  
The linearity controls verify the reportable range of Beckman Coulter hematology systems. Linearity 
is performed at installation, at least yearly, and whenever experiencing an altitude change of 1 mile or more between locations using Beckman Coulter Lin-X
™. 
Beckman Coulter Lin -X linearity controls are human blood components from which re peated 
measurements verify the reportable range of Beckman Coulter hematology systems that use both Beckman Coulter® III diluent and Lyse S
® III diff lytic reagent. Controls contain one each of Ultra
