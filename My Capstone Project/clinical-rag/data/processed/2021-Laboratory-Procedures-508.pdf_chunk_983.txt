filter onto and around the critical work area. The filter of the LFBSC is a permanent part of the 
disposable plenum. A magnehelic gauge is calibrated in “ inches of water gauge  (w.g. )” pressure. The 
gauge indicates when the supply HEPA filter is clogged. As the filter loads with particulate matter, 
the amount of pressure registered on the gauge will increase. The initial pressure reading is 
approximately 0.4 w.g. + 0.05 w.g. depending  on the altitude from sea level.
