which ﬁ  lter up to 5 microns; and (iii) HEPA ﬁ  lters which keep out up to 0.3 microns 
with 99.97% efﬁ  ciency. 
There is evidence that there is a lower incidence of infection when immune- 
compromised and other high-acuity patients are housed in HEPA-ﬁ  ltered isolation 
rooms.

This is HEPA-ﬁ  ltered air blown in a unidirectional pattern with 100–400 ACH. LAF 
systems are thought to minimize contamination of the surgical ﬁ  eld with airborne 
microbes and thus to contribute to reducing surgical site infections (SSIs). LAF systems should be available for prolonged procedures such as transplant and replacement surgery, neurosurgery, orthopaedic and implant surgery.
