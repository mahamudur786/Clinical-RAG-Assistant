Calculation of incidence
x Device days and patient-days are used for denominators.
x Ventilator days, which are the number of patients managed with a ventilatory 
device, are collected daily, at the same time each day, according to the chosen location.
The VAP rate per 1000 ventilator days is calculated by dividing the number of VAPs 
by the number of ventilator days and multiplying the result by 1000.
