• Prepare the blood collection set. Obtain one blood collection set and one luer adapter. 
Open the blood collection package and inspect the unit. Open the cover by twisting the 
two ends at the seal. Push the male luer adapter firmly and securely into the female end of the needle assembly. Attach a tube holder onto the adapter. 
• Ask the SP to make a fist. Do not have the SP pump their  fist since this action may alter 
certain results.  
• Fix the vein about 1 inch below the proposed point of entry by pulling the skin taut with the thumb of your less dominant hand.
