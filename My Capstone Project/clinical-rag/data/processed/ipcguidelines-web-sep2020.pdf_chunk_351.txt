x The initial dose of prophylactic antimicrobial agent should be administered by 
the intravenous route, timed such that a bactericidal concentration of the drug is established in the serum and tissues when the incision is made. 
x Administration of SAP should be within 120 minutes of incision, while 
considering the half-life of the antibiotic.
x Clinicians should consider the half-life and protein binding as the most 
important pharmacokinetic parameters of any single SAP agent in order to ensure adequate serum and tissue concentration at the time of incision and during the entire surgical procedure. 
x SAP should not be prolonged after completion of the operation and is not 
recommended in the presence of a wound drain for the purpose of preventing SSI.
