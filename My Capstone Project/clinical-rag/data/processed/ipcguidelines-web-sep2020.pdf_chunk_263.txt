x Ensure appropriate room ventilation (>12 ACH). 
x Ensure directional control of air ﬂ  ow, with air ﬂ  ow entering the room only when 
the door is open, and exhausted outside safely. 
x In naturally ventilated airborne precaution rooms, the air ﬂ  ow should be 
directed to areas free of transit, or safely outside where it may be diluted. 
x In mechanically ventilated airborne precaution rooms, to control the direction 
of air ﬂ  ow the pressure of the room should be maintained slightly less than the 
pressure of the entry area (i.e. “negative pressure”), so that air ﬂ  ows into the 
room when doors are open:R clean-to-dirty airﬂ  ow; 
R a negative pressure differential of >2.5 Pa (0.01-inch water gauge); 
R an airﬂ  ow differential >125-cfm (56 L/s) exhaust relative to supply;
