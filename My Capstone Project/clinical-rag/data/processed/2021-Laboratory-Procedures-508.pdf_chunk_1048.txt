 Centrifuges 
Overview . Each MEC has  two centrifuge s. Both centrifuge s are operated at refrigerated 
temperature s (4°C to 8 °C). All blood tubes can be spun in the refrigerated centrifuge. 
While power is generally required to open or unlock the centrifuge door, an emergency pull cord 
under the centrifuge will allow the technologists to open the door to retrieve the blood tubes if a 
power failure occurs.  
Consequences.  According to the manufacturer, a ll blood tubes can remain in the locked centrifuge 
for up to 4 hours; however, for optimal test results, serum/plasma should be separated from the red 
blood cells within 2 hours from collection.
