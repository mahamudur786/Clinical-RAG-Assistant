140 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Box 7.1. Calculation of SSI rates
x SSI rates per 100 operative procedures are calculated by dividing the number of 
SSIs by the number of speciﬁ  c operative procedures and multiplying the result by 
100. 
x SSIs will be included in the numerator of a rate based on the date of procedure, not 
the date of the HAI event. 
x SSI rates can be calculated separately for different types of operative 
procedures and stratiﬁ  ed by the wound classiﬁ  cation (clean, clean contaminated, 
contaminated, dirty).
Classiﬁ  cation of the surgical wound
All surgical wounds are not uniformly prone to infection. 
x The type of wound inﬂ  uences the risk of infection.
x It also aids in ﬁ  nding the source of infection.
