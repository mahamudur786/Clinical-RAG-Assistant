suites, laboratories and individual rooms for patients with TB.
Filtration devices perform poorly in high-dust conditions, as the effectiveness in 
terms of equivalent air exchange can diminish rapidly. Attention should be given to the equivalent air exchanges per hour that the ﬁ  lter requires. If ﬁ  lters are chosen, 
only true-HEPA membrane ﬁ  lters (rated to remove 99.97% of 1-micron particles) 
should be entertained. 
Other ﬁ  ltration mechanisms, such as ionizers, have not been adequately studied.
The use of single rooms with HEPA ﬁ  ltration may reduce the risk of HAI by airborne 
fungi, in particular Aspergillus  spp. This is particularly important where renovation,
