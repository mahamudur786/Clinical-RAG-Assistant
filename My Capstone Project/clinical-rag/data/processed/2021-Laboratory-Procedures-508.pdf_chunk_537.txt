If RBC parameters are out of range, evaluate the data for drift.  If drift is evident, evaluate  the 
possibility of an instrument malfunction. If any WBC differential absolute number is out of range, 
check the WBC scattergram for abnormal cell population(s). Evaluate and save results when 
precision limits are not exceeded.
