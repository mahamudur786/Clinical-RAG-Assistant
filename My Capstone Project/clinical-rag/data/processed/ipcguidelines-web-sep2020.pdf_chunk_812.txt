xThe temperature in the OT should be between 18 and 24 °C. The room should have central 
air-conditioning. Window air conditioners are a source of contamination and have no place in an OT. 
xThe surfaces of ﬂ  oors and walls of the OT should be as hard, non-porous and smooth as 
possible. Ceramic tiles are not ideal because the grouting between the tiles can harbour microorganisms. There should be no cracks and crevices since cracks and crevices can harbour microorganisms and cannot be cleaned properly. A special paint called epoxy paint is particularly suitable for the walls of the OT. The joint between the walls and ﬂ  oor should 
be curved for easy cleaning.
xThe operation table should be placed away from the entrance.
