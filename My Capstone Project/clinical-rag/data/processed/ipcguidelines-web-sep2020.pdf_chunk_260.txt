66 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
Heating ventilation and air-conditioning systems
In modern hospitals, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems 
control the concentration of airborne particulates in high-risk areas such as transplant units, operation theatres, intensive care units, and burn units to minimize the risk of infection by means of air pressure, ﬂ  ow control and air ﬁ  ltration (the physical removal of particulates from air). The three types of ﬁ  ltration used in central 
airconditioning are (i) coarse or pre-ﬁ  lters for large particles; (ii) micro-ﬁ  ne ﬁ lters 
which ﬁ  lter up to 5 microns; and (iii) HEPA ﬁ  lters which keep out up to 0.3 microns 
with 99.97% efﬁ  ciency.
