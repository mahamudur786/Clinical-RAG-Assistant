Exhibit 9- 5. Westgard Rule  R4S 
Rule R 4S. This rule rejects a run if there is at least a 4 SD difference between control values 
within a single run. For example, Level 1 control is +2.9 SD above the mean and Level 2 
is -1.4 SD  below the mean. The total difference between the two control levels is greater than 
4 SD. This rule identifies random error and is applied only within the current run. 
Note: 
Violation of any of the following rules does not necessarily require rejection of the analytical 
run. These violations typically identify smaller systematic error s or analytical bias that is not often 
clinically significant or relevant. Analytical bias may be eliminated by performing calibration or 
instrument maintenance.
