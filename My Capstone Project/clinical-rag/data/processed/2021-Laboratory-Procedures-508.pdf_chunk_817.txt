9.6.9 Calibration Verification  
Calibration verification is defined by CLIA as “ the assaying of calibration materials in the same 
manner as survey participant specimens to confirm that the calibration of the instrument, kit, or test 
system has remained stable throughout the laboratory’ s reportable range for survey participant test 
results. ” Thus, calibration verification ensures that the accuracy of the measurement process across 
the reportable range is ma intained over time. For methods approved by the FDA, calibration 
verification is performed according to the manufacturer’ s specification and at the frequency 
recommended by the manufacturer.
