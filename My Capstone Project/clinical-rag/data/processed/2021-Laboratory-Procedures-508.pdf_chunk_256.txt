 Problem Identification  
Rare occurrences of critical CBC results, particularly low platelet counts, have been observed that 
resulted in a medical referral for the clinic ians on the MEC. While the clinical laboratory scientist s 
and clinician  may suspect  laboratory instrument error or blood collection a ffecting reported results, 
it is not standard practice to repeat the test with a new blood specimen from a second phlebotomy. 
There is  nothing in the phlebotomy, laboratory, and clinician  protocols that requires a second blood 
draw on an SP when critical results are obtained.  This is only done at the clinician ’s request.
