Ventilation can reduce the risk of infection through dilution and removal of infectious 
particles through air exchange. Improved ventilation in HCFs is essential in preventing transmission of TB and other airborne infections.

Table 5.1 gives a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of different types of ventilation systems for healthcare settings.

Natural ventilation
x Refers to fresh air that enters and leaves a room or other area through 
openings such as windows or doors. 
x Natural ventilation is “controlled” when openings are ﬁ  xed and unrestricted to 
maintain air ﬂ  ow at all times.
x Unrestricted openings (i.e. those that cannot be closed) on opposite sides of a 
room provide the most effective natural ventilation.
