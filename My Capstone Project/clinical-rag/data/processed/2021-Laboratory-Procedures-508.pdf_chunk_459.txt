highlighted in yellow for that parameter if N>=2 and N<15, or in red if N>=15.  
RMSE  Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) displays when Extended QC is enabled. The RMSE is 
a Single Measurement Error. If the value exceeds the Single Measurement Error limit, the RMSE value will be highlighted in yellow for that parameter if N>=2 and 
N<15. The value is highlighted in red if N>=15.  
If the parameter’s target is not applicable, NA  displays in this field.  
N The number of included points within the specified filter.  
Target  The assigned target of the parameter being used in your lab at the time of the 
control analysis. The target used by Extended QC will be based on what has been 
configured for t raditional QC (either assigned or Mean to Target values).
