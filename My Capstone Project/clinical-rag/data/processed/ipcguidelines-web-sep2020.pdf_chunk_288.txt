Water storage tanks
Due to the lack of continuous running water, many hospitals have to use stored water. These storage tanks can be large overhead tanks or smaller tanks at the ward level. Overhead storage tanks should have the capacity to store 48 hours of water requirement.
Large overhead water tanks 
Water storage tanks should be covered with appropriate sealed lids and need to be under lock and key. The tanks should be thoroughly cleaned at regular intervals.
Water storage tanks at ward level
x The cleaning of the potable water storage tank at the ward level should be 
done daily and the tank must be provided with a tap or stop cock.
x The tank should be kept securely covered at all times.
