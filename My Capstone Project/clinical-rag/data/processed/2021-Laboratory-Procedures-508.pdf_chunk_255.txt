3.16 Repeat Blood Draw  
In rare circumstances, a result from the complete blood count may be an extreme value that would 
be considered a “ panic ” value in clinical practice. An example is severe thrombocytopen ia. The 
clinician  may repeat the complete blood count if the participant reports no history of nosebleeds or 
prolonged bleeding and the clinician  verifies that the site of the first venipuncture clotted normally. 
The second complete blood count will overwr ite the first results in ISIS and will be used for 
reporting and referrals.
