Human factors affecting safety
A number of individual factors affect a person’s performance, thus predisposing them to error. Two factors with the greatest impact are fatigue and stress. Strong scientiﬁ  c evidence links fatigue and impaired performance, making it a known risk 
factor for safe practice. It is important to recognize that low levels of stress are also counterproductive, as they can lead to boredom and failure to attend to a task with appropriate vigilance.
