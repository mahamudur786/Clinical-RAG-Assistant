Guidance for collection of environmental samples
x Culture should be done after the data have been received from the line-list and 
observations.
x Culture should be done only of things that are likely routes of transmission 
(high-touch surfaces).
x Culture should be guided by the epidemiology of the organism (e.g. Serratia 
spp. – ﬂ  uids, VRE objects/ surfaces)
x Epidemiological typing of the organisms isolated using phenotypic and 
genotypic methods may be performed to identify the characteristics of the pathogen causing the outbreak.
