x likelihood that such an exposure will cause a laboratory-associated infection 
and probable consequences of such an infection. 
Risk assessment guides the selection of appropriate biosafety levels and required 
microbiological practices and safety equipment (primary barriers) and facility level safeguards (secondary barriers) that can prevent laboratory-associated infections. Table 6.6 gives detailed information on biosafety levels.
The risk assessment process should be integrated within the overall management 
of laboratory services. Risk assessment can be simpliﬁ  ed into the following steps.
