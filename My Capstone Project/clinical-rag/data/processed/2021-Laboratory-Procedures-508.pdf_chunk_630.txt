Cells for Acrylamide (Vessel  88), Folate Forms (Vessel 221), and Fatty Acids 
(Vessel 222)  
Remove whole blood as needed for vessels 1 , 5, and 3 (Lead/Cad/HG/Se/Mn; Mercury,  Ethyl , and 
Methyl ; BChe ; and RBC Folate ). Centrifuge the EDTA tube and remove the plasma as described 
below . Wash the remaining red blood cells (erythrocytes) with sterile saline three times  and then add 
a 1:1 ratio of saline to the washed RBCs to make a homogeneous solution. Invert the tube 8- 10 
times to create the solution, using special care to not rupture the cells by mixing too hard during the 
process. Store the saline in the refrig erator and use it cold. Pour saline to be used for the cell 
washing procedure into a squeeze bottle. Ensure the saline bottle is properly labeled to include the
