• Accuracy of each analytical method will be determined by analysis of calibrators and 
yearly linearity checks as described in the section of th is manual on quality control. 
• Precision  of each analytical method is determined by analysis of QC reference materials 
as described in the section of this manual on quality control. 
• Analytical specificity  is determined for each method, including effects of potential 
interfering substances by the manufacturer. This may be verified by testing the effect of 
potential interfering substances in method development, by analyzing reference 
materials, comparing results on split samples with a method considered more definitive, 
or analyzing a sample of persons (n>20) and examining the measurement output
