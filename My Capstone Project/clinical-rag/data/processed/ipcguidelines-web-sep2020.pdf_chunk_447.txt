Laboratory design and facilities
In designing a laboratory, special attention should be paid to conditions that are known to pose safety problems. Overcrowding and too much equipment must be avoided. Infestation with rodents and arthropods must be prevented. 
Design features for biosafety
x There should be a designated area for collecting blood and other clinical 
samples, physically separated from the patient waiting room and specimen processing area. 
x Handwashing basins, with running water if possible, should be provided in 
each laboratory room, preferably near the exit door.
x Ample space must be provided for the safe conduct of laboratory work and for 
cleaning and maintenance.
x Walls, ceilings and ﬂ  oors should be coved and slip-resistant, which allow
