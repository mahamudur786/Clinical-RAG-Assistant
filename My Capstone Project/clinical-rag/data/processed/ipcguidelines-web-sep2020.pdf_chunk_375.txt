x Antiseptics should be allowed to dry according to the manufacturer’s 
recommendation before placing the catheter.
Antibiotic prophylaxis x Systemic antimicrobials should not be routinely administered before insertion 
or during use of a central venous catheter to prevent catheter colonization or CLABSI.

Care of pressure monitoring systems 
x Keep all components of the pressure monitoring system (including calibration 
devices and ﬂ  ush solution) sterile.
x Minimize the number of manipulations of and entries into the pressure 
monitoring system. Use a closed-ﬂ  ush system (i.e. continuous ﬂ  ush), rather 
than an open system (i.e. one that requires a syringe and stopcock) to maintain the patency of pressure monitoring catheters.
