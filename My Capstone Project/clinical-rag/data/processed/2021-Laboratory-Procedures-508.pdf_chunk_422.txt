– Level 11 is used to clean the system. The values for this level are not recorded.  
• How to run linearity in the MEC:  
– Run each level under a separate repeatability —this is useful since it will calculate 
the mean for that level of Lin -X. 
– Print out the summary report for each level of Lin- X. 
– Write the level number on the top of each summary report. 
– Document all values on the Coulter Lin-X Control Worksheet. Do not forget to 
record the kit lot number on the worksheet. This number is different from the lot number for each of the tubes. 
– Send worksheet, package insert, and summary reports in the end of stand box to the Lab Component Lead at the home office in Rockville, MD.
