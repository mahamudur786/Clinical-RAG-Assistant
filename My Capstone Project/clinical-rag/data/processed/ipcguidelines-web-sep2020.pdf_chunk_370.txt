Peripheral 
arterial cathetersUsually inserted in radial 
artery; can be placed in femoral, axillary, brachial, posterior tibial arteries<7.5 cm Low infection risk; rarely 
associated with BSI
Midline 
cathetersInserted via the 
antecubital fossa into the proximal basilic or cephalic veins; does not enter central veins, peripheral catheters7.5–20 cm Anaphylactoid reactions 
have been reported with catheters made of elastomeric hydrogel; lower rates of phlebitis than short peripheral catheters

central venous catheters (CVCs)Percutaneously inserted 
into central veins (subclavian, internal jugular or femoral)t8 cm
