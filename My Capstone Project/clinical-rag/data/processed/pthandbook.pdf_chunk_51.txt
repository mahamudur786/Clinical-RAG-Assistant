which patients or volunteers participate- 
clinical research-takes place mainly in the 
Clini cal Cent er in Bethesda, Maryland. 
The medica l and other personal information 
you are asked to give, as well as the 
informatio n from various tests, is gathered for 
two purposes: to provide the best care and 
treatment for you as a patient, and to allow 
for research to increase understanding of 
health and illness. Both good treatment and 
good research depend on accurate and 
complete information. However, just as you 
coming to the Clinical Center as a patient is 
voluntary, you giving the information we 
request and participating in various tests and 
researc h procedures is also voluntary.
