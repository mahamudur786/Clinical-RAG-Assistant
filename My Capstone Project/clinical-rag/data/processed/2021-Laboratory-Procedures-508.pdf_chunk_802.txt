Exhibit 9- 4. Westgard Rule  22S 
Rule 2 2S. There are two rej ection criteria for this rule: T wo consecutive QC results that are 
greater than 2 SD that are on the same side of the mean. Violation within the run indicates 
that systematic error is present and that it potentially affects the entire analytical curve. 
Violation across the run indicates that only a single portion of the analytical curve is affected 
by the error. The control run is rejected with two  consecutive control measurements that are

this rul e.
