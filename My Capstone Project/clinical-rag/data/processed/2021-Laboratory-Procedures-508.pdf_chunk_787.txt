In this context, QC procedures monitor and evaluate the quality of the analytical testing process of 
each method to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results. Thus, QC procedures referenced here ref er to the analytical phase of testing and not to the pre-analytic or post- analytic phases. QA 
addresses all three phases of measurement: pre -analytic, analytic, and post -analytic. QC is therefore 
viewed here as one part of the overall QA process.  
9.6.2 Method -Specific QC Procedures  
Specific QC procedures exist for each analytical laboratory procedure in the LPM.  The following are 
some general aspects of QC procedures.
