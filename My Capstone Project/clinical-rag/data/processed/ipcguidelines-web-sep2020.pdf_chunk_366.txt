There are four recognized routes for contamination of catheters:
98 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
x Migration of skin organisms at the insertion site into the cutaneous catheter 
tract and along the surface of the catheter with colonization of the catheter tip (most common route of infection for short-term catheters)
x Direct contamination of the catheter or catheter hub by contact with hands or 
contaminated ﬂ  uids or devices
x Through the bloodstream from another focus of infection 
x Contaminated infusate
