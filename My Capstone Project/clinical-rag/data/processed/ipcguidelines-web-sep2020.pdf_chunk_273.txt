x For decontamination of small spills (<10 ml), if sodium hypochlorite solution 
is selected, use a 1:100 dilution (525–615 ppm of available chlorine) (Table 5.3). If spills involve larger amounts of blood, or involve a spill of microbiology cultures in the laboratory, a 1:10 dilution of hypochlorite solution for ﬁ  rst 
application (before cleaning) reduces the risk of infection during cleaning. After the ﬁ rst application, remove the visible organic matter with absorbent material 
(e.g. disposable paper towels), discard into leak-proof, labelled bag/ container and then dispose of as per waste management guidelines.
