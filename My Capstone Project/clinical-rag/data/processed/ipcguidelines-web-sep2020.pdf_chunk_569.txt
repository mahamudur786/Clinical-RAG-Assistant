Adherence to standard precautions and transmission-based precautions help in 
protecting HCWs as well as patients from transmission of infection in HCFs (see Chapter 4). 
Safe work practices help in preventing exposure to hazards in the workplace. (For 
special precautions during pandemic-prone diseases, see Chapter 7.)
Bloodborne infections in healthcare settings
Of the 35 million HCWs worldwide, three million experience percutaneous exposure to bloodborne pathogens every year. Of these, there are two million exposures to HBV, 0.9 million to HCV and 170 000 to HIV. This results in 70 000 HBV, 15 000 HCV and 1000 HIV infections. More than 90% of these infections occur in developing countries.
