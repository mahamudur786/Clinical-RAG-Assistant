End of Stand Rotor  Packing Procedure  
Remove rotors from the Allegra X -15R centrifuges and pack in plastic bins designed for rotor 
storage, for safe traveling. The balance detection mechanism is very sensitive during travel and needs 
to be protected. 
Store the rotor inside of the foam-lined bin. Place the white, cross-shaped hard foam piece onto the 
rotor spindle after removing the rotor. The hard foam should remain in place until the start of the next stand. See photos (Exhibits 10-4 and 10-5) for proper packing.
