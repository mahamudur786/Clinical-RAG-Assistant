The laboratory will satisfactorily participate in the HCFA -approved PT program for each method 
used to analyze human samples. Performance in the PT program, along with documentation of remedial action taken for unacceptable performance, is documented in a QC logbook that is available for review.  
CAP samples are sent three  times a year for hematology. Each shipment includes five 2.5 -mL whole 
blood specimens. Duplicate Beckman Coulter CBC determinations are performed on each whole blood sample using procedures described in Chapter 6. PT samples are handled and analyzed in a manner identical to SP samples, including the precision limits established to compare the duplicate 
runs of each sample. Results are entered and submitted electronically via the CAP website
