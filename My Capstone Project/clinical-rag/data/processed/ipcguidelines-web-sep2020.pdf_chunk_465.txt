The above table relates but does not “equate” risk groups to the biosafety level of laboratories designed to work with organism s in each risk 
group. Some hazard group 2 biological agents, such as Neisseria meningitides , are seen as higher risk to laboratory workers on the basis that 
they are transmitted by the airborne route. If an accident involving such agents was to occur in a BSL-2 laboratory, it would n ot be possible
