Effective infection prevention and control is central to providing 
high-quality healthcare for patients and a safe working environment for those who work in healthcare settings. It is important to minimize the risk of spread of infection to patients and staff in hospitals by implementing a robust infection control programme.
Prevention of infections reduces the need to use antibiotics and 
thereby reduces the use of antibiotics and development of antimicrobial resistance. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is coordinating the National Programme for AMR Containment and one of the objectives of the programme is to strengthen infection prevention and control in state medical college hospitals.
