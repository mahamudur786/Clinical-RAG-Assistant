x hand hygiene is important since contact transmission can occur in respiratory 
viral infections when respiratory secretions or droplets contaminate surfaces, which can contaminate the hands of HCWs.
Combination of contact, droplet and airborne precautions
Contact, droplet and airborne precautions may be combined for diseases that have multiple routes of transmission or in case of epidemiologically important organisms, risk group 4 organisms or where transmission routes are unknown. Combined precautions are recommended in case of Ebola and Nipah virus disease. They are always to be used in addition to standard precautions and should be applied to all suspects, probable and conﬁ  rmed cases.
