Surgical-site infection
This is infection at the site of surgery, earlier called wound infection. The incidence 
of surgical-site infections (SSIs) varies from 0.5% to 15% depending on the type of operation and underlying status of the patient. The main risk factor is the extent of contamination during the procedure (clean, clean contaminated, contaminated, dirty), which is largely dependent on the site of surgery, length of the operation, and the patient’s general condition.
