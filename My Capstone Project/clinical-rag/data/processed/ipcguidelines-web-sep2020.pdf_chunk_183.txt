goggles. The face shield should cover the forehead, extend below the chin, 
and wrap around the side of the face.
x Masks are worn where appropriate to protect the mucous membranes of 
the nose and mouth during procedures and patient-care activities likely to generate droplets and splashes or sprays of blood, body ﬂ  uids, secretions 
and excretions. Masks should fully cover the nose and mouth and prevent ﬂ uid penetration.Triple-layer surgical masks ﬁ  tted tightly to the face should be 
worn, and discarded immediately after use. If the mask gets wet or dirty with secretions, it must be changed immediately.
