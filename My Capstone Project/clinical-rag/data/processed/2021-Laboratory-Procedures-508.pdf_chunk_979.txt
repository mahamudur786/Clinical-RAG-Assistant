room temperature digital thermometer  (Temp -Guard). Placing the traceable 
thermometer probe next to the digital thermometer probe yields more consistent results.  The same thermometer can be used for the refrigerators and room temperature 
checks . 
• Allow the thermometer to remain in the environment to equilibrate for a sufficient 
amount of time . Avoid opening and closing the refrigerator and freezer doors during 
this time . 
• After the thermometers have equilibrated, record the temperature from the traceable thermometer and the digital thermometer  on the Laboratory NIST Temperature Check 
Sheet .
