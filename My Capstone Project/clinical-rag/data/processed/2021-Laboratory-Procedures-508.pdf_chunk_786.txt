laboratory scientist performing the assay to detect error outside of previously 
determined limits before reporting data; documentation of daily bench performance for 
detection of less obvious error (particularly those that tend to accumulate over time, so-
called “ drift”); and established procedures to be followed wherever error is found to 
exceed previously determined limits.  
5. Instrumentation.  This includes periodic preventive maintenance of all instruments in 
use in the laboratory and documentation that each instrument is maintaining a 
previously dete rmined level of each performance at each check.  
In this context, QC procedures monitor and evaluate the quality of the analytical testing process of
