An average adult male has 12 pints of blood and an average adult female has 9 pints. The Red Cross 
routinely draws 450 mL  (or one pint) during a routine donation. Their requirements limit donation 
to every 8 weeks. The  maximum volume drawn  with an NHANES phlebotomy amounts to slightly 
more than 25 percent (128 mL ) of the amount drawn by the Red Cross. The body manufactures 
blood daily and replaces this volume of blood within 24 hours.

There is absolutely no possibility of the SPs being infected by any blood-borne disease, such as 
hepatitis or HIV , due  to participation in the venipuncture component of the NHANES exam.
