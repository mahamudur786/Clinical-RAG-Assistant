3. These new National Guidelines for IPC in Healthcare Facilities will enhance  
patient safety and the capacity of health workers to prevent and control infections in Indian hospitals. These guidelines shall prevent current and future threats from infectious diseases such as Nipah, Ebola, and will help in strengthening health service resilience, combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and improve the overall quality of healthcare delivery. 
4. These guidelines are suitable for all those who are providing healthcare 
services, especially those who are delivering tertiary care. These can be adapted to local situations and patient proﬁ  les. I am sure that the guidelines will help in setting global standards for controlling the HAIs and will be found useful by all the stakeholders.
