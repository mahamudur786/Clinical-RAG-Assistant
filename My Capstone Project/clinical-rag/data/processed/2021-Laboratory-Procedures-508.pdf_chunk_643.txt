7.5.7 Ascorbic Acid Processing and Preparation  
The CDC supplies premeasured powder to make a 1 percent  ascorbic  acid (AA)  for vessel 3 (RBC 
Folate)  and a premeasured powder to make 7 percent AA solution for vessel 110 (Folate 1). 
Prepare both reagents before processing the blood samples. Cover tubes with aluminum foil to

pipetting and performing the dilution. Use the Eppendorf Research pro pipettes to make the 
dilution. Add 0.1 mL of whole blood to 1.0 mL of 1 percent  ascorbic acid for vessel 3 (RBC
