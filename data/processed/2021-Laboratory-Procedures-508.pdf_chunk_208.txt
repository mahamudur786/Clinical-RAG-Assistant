• Cleanse the area with an alcohol wipe. Do not touch the side of the alcohol wipe that is 
in contact with the puncture site. Cleanse the area using a scrubbing back and forth 
motion . Do not cross over an area that has already been cleansed.  
• Wait for the cleansed are a to dry. The area should be completely dry before performing 
the venipuncture to reduce the burning sensation caused by alcohol penetrating the skin. 
• Determine the correct needle size. Use a 19 -, 21-, or 23-gauge butterfly depending on 
the condition of the SP’ s veins. The 19- gauge  butterfly should be suitable for most SPs. 
If the SP ’s veins appear fragile or small, use a 21 - or 23 -gauge butterfly.
