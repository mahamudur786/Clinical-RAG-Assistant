x The installation of “whirlybirds” (also known as whirligigs or wind turbines) that 
do not use electricity and provide a roof exhaust system can greatly increase both ventilation and comfort.
Considerations for cold climates 
In cold climates, high ventilation rates may adversely affect thermal comfort, and are difﬁ  cult to achieve as windows may be closed to keep the building warm. Even 
if normal heating is introduced, high ventilation rates usually mean low energy efﬁ ciency. Therefore, ventilation and heating strategies must be planned carefully.
