Agent
The microorganism capable of causing the infection is known as the infective agent. 
Infective agents include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, helminths and prions. The ability of a microorganism to cause infection depends upon its ability to invade, proﬁ ciency in overcoming the host defences, its pathogenicity, degree of virulence,

Reservoir 
A reservoir is the source of the infectious agent where it lives and multiplies. These can be animate (humans, animals) or inanimate (the environment, contaminated food and water). 
Human reservoirs can be symptomatic (exhibiting signs and symptoms of the
