Types of vascular catheters
Table 6.1 gives details of various types of catheters used for venous and arterial 
access.
Selection of catheter type 
Central venous catheters may be made from different materials, single or multi-lumen, medically impregnated, e.g. antimicrobial, antiseptic or heparin bonded, cuffed and designed to be tunnelled or having totally implantable ports. 
x Polytetraﬂ  uoroethylene or polyurethane catheters have been associated with 
fewer infectious complications than catheters made of polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene but there is no evidence that demonstrates conclusively that CLABSI rates vary with different materials. 
x Generally polyurethane is considered suitable for short-term use, and silicone 
for long-term use.
