IV therapy and umbilical catheter care
Umbilical vessel catheters are frequently used in the initial management of the sick neonate. There is increased potential of bacterial colonization as this site is non-sterile and there is the presence of devitalized cord tissue. Umbilical catheters should be replaced by percutaneous peripheral or central venous catheters in neonates requiring long-term access.
x Umbilical catheters should be inserted using sterile techniques.
x Umbilical catheters should only be replaced if the catheter site is infected or the 
catheter malfunctions.
x Do not replace the umbilical catheter if there are signs of CRBSI or thrombosis.
