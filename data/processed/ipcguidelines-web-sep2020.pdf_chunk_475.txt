Biosafety cabinets
These are to be used when performing procedures with high potential for producing infectious aerosols. These include:
x Open-fronted Class I and Class II biosafety cabinets are primary barriers 
that offer signiﬁ  cant levels of protection to laboratory personnel and to the 
environment when used with good microbiological techniques. 
x The Class II biological safety cabinet also provides protection from external 
contamination of the materials (e.g. cell cultures, microbiological stocks) being manipulated inside the cabinet. 
x The gas-tight Class III biological safety cabinet provides the highest attainable 
level of protection to personnel and the environment.
