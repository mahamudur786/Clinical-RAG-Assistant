Single-dose and multi-dose vials 
x Whenever possible, use a single-dose vial for each patient to reduce cross-
contamination between patients.
x Open only one vial of a particular medication at a time in each patient-care 
area.
x If possible, keep one multi-dose vial for each patient, and store it with the 
patient’s name on the vial in a separate treatment or medication room.
x Do not store multi-dose vials in the open ward or general patient-care area, 
where they could be inadvertently contaminated.
