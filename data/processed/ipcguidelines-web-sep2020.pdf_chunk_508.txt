Calculation of incidence
Patient-days and urinary catheter days are the denominators used to determine 
incidence rates for UTI and CAUTI, respectively. 
Urinary catheter days is the number of patients with a catheter in the ICU under 
surveillance each day.
Patient-day denominator is calculated as the total number of patients per day in the 
ICU under surveillance. 
NICUs may collect the denominator data stratiﬁ  ed by categories of birth weight 
x <1000 g; 
x <1001–1500 g; 
x <1501–2500 g; and 
x > 2500 g. 
Data should be analysed for all UTIs combined and stratiﬁ  ed by device association 
(e.g. CAUTI vs non-CAUTI). Incidence rates should be calculated for both total UTIs and CAUTI, as described below.
UTI incidence rate (UTI per 1000 patient-days): divide the number of reported UTIs
