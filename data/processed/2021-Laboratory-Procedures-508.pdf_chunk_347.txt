® 25 hCG (Urine/Serum) test kit is a rapid chromatographic 
immunoassay for the qualitative detection of hCG in urine or serum to aid in the early detection of 
pregnancy.  Pregnancy test s will be performed solely on urine for NHANES. 
In normal pregnancy, hCG can be detected in urine as early as 7 -10 days after conception. The 
hCG levels continue to rise very rapidly, frequently exceeding 100 mIU/m L (milli-international 
units per milliliter)  by the first missed menstrual period and peaking in the 100,000- 200,000 
mIU/ml range about 10- 12 weeks into pregnancy. The appearance of hCG in urine soon after 
conception, and its subsequent rapid raise in concentration during early gestational growth, make 
an excellent marker for the detection of pregnancy.
