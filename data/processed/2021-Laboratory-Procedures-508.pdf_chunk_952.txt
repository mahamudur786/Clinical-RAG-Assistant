and prevents run initiation unless the door is shut and locked. The door is locked when 
a run is in progress and can be opened only when the rotor is stopped and the LED 
(light -emitting diode) next to the DOOR key is lit. If there is a power failure, the door 
lock can be manually tripped for sample recovery.  
• A steel barrier surrounds the rotor chamber to provide full operator protection. 
• A rotor identification system prevents the installed rotor from running above its maximum rated speed. During acceleration the microprocessor checks the magnetic 
rotor identification. Speed is limited to the maximum safe speed of the i dentified rotor. 
If the system identifies a rotor different than the one entered by the user, the system
