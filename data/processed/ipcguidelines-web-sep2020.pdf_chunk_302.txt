kitchen. The trays are dispensed in the ward. Food should be handled in a hygienic manner throughout this process. Trays should be kept covered when food is served in the ward. 
x Dietary workers should be taught to observe standard precautions to protect 
themselves and patients.
Cleaning of utensils
