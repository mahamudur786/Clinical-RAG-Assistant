Injection safety53 
Injection safety is an important component of standard precautions.
Use of injection devices
Practical guidance on the use of injection devices is given below:
x Use a new injection device for each procedure, including for the reconstitution 
of a unit of medication or vaccine.
x Inspect the packaging of the injection device to ensure that the protective 
barrier has not been breached.
Discard the device if the package has been punctured, torn or damaged by exposure 
to moisture, or if the expiry date has passed.
Single-dose and multi-dose vials 
x Whenever possible, use a single-dose vial for each patient to reduce cross-
contamination between patients.
