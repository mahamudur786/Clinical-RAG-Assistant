detection of the processed samples. The TTM produced three measurement signals —volume, 
conductivity, and light scatter.  
The DxH 800 system replaces the TTM with the Multi -Transducer Module (MTM), which measures 
additiona l multiple angles of light scatter, a major improvement over the single light scatter measured 
by the TTM.  All Diff, NRBC, and Retic analysis occurs in the Volume Conductivity and Scatter 
properties module. The VCSn module is responsible for controlled sample preparation and delivery 
of the prepared sample to the flow cell for analysis of the WBC differential, reticulocyte , and NRBC. 
The VCSn module includes the Air Mix and Temperature Control (AMTC) and the MTM.
