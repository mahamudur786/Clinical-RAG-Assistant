directional airﬂ  ow control is shown in Fig. 5.2. In “A” the supply of air is on one side 
and exhaust on the other; whereas in “B”, the supply is from the top and exhaust near the patients’ head and foot end.
Filtration (HEPA ﬁ  lters)
Filtration is another option to remove infectious particles from the air. Filtration may 
be considered where:
x sustainable resources for membrane replacement and maintenance are 
assured; 
x natural ventilation is not possible; and
x risk of airborne transmission and morbidity are high such as bronchoscopy 
suites, laboratories and individual rooms for patients with TB.
Filtration devices perform poorly in high-dust conditions, as the effectiveness in
