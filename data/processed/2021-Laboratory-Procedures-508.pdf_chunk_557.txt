6.19.5  Clinician  Review  
The MEC clinician  reviews and interprets all CBC results. Results outside action limits flash and 
transmit to the clinician  immediately.  The clinician  determines if referral for the SP for treatment is 
necessary.  The clinical laboratory scientist  sends an observation to the clinician  whenever a critical or 
action limit is detected for any CBC parameter .
