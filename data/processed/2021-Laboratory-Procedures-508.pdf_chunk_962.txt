10.4 .1.1 Centrifuge Cleaning  
Clean the centrifuge as needed and at the end of each stand. Always clean up spills when they occur 
to prevent corrosives or contaminants from drying on component surfaces. Clean spills according to 
COVID -19 mitigation procedures. 
• To prevent accumulations of sample dust, and/or glass particles from broken sample 
tubes, keep the chamber clean and dry by frequent wiping with a cloth or paper towel.  
• For thorough cleaning, wash the chamber using a mild detergent such as a 1:10 dilution of Beckman Solution 555.  
• Rinse thoroughly and dry completely.
