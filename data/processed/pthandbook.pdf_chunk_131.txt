incoming collect calls. 
On each patient care unit, a telephone is 
provided for long-distance calls at no expense 
to you. Calls may be placed from 6 a.m. to 8 
a.m. and from 6 p.m. to midnigh t. We urge you 
to limit your calls to 10 minutes in 
consideration of your fellow patients who 
may also need access to the telephone. If you 
cannot get to this telephone, ask your social 
worker to authorize a long-distance call from 
your room telephone. Family and friends may 
call you directly. If they do not have your 
number, they can reach you through the NIH 
operator at 301-496- 4000. As a courtesy to 
other patients, please ask family and friends 
to call before 10 p.m.
