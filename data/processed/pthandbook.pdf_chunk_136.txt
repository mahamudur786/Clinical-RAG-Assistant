check with nursing staff for more information 
before entering your room. If you require 
isolation, your nurse or doctor will explain  
this to you. To protect patient confidentiality, 
isolation signs do not identify the patient's 
infection. 
During cold and flu season, it is important to 
let your doctor or nurse know at once if you 
have a cough, sore throat, runny nose, or 
congestion. Visitors with these symptoms 
should avoid coming to the Clinical Center 
until their symptoms resolve. 
You can receive more information about

Hospital Epidemiology Service at 301-496-
