• Ensure that the SPM is set up for the appropriate test for your workflow.  
• Ensure that specimens have been collected and stored properly.  
• Load the specimens into the cassettes.  Narrow tubes with small internal diameters will 
require manual premixing prior to analysis to ensure proper cell and plasma distribution 
and to avoid possible erroneous results. Premix these tubes before placing them in the 
cassette and then analyze the cassette by placing it in the Stat position of the input 
buffer.  
• Place the cassettes in the input buffer to the right of the SPM. The  SPM automatica lly 
begins cycling the cassettes.
