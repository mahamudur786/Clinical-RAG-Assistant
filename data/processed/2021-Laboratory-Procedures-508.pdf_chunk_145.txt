4 SPs selected f or inclusion in the Dioxin/BFR and  Perfluor subsample One third (0,3,7,10) (12+)  
5 SPs i ncluded in Thyroid full sample (3-5) 
6 SPs selected for inclusion in the Thyroid and  Serum Terpenes subsample One third (1,2,5,11) (12+) 
If the veins of an SP appear too fragile to accommodate the size of the large red -top tubes, 
substitute smaller red -top tubes as an alternative protocol. Exhibit 3-2, Alternative venipuncture 
protocol—primary, illustrates the alternative size and number of tubes in boldface with the original 
tube protocol in parentheses. When the alternative protocol is substituted for the original protocol, a comment must be recorded. This protocol constitutes a deviation from the established standard; it 
should be used only in rare circumstances.
