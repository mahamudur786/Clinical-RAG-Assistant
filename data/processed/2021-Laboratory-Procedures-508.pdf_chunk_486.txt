characteristics different from conventional light sources.  
The safe use of the laser depends upon familiarity with the instrument and the properties of 
coherent, intense beams of light. The beam can cause eye damage and instrument damage.  There is 
enough power from the laser to ignite substances placed in the beam path, even at some distance. The beam might also c ause damage if contacted indirectly from reflective surfaces (specular 
reflection).  The laser on the DxH 800 is covered by a protective housing.
