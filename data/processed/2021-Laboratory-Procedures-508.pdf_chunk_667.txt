8.1 Introduction  
Sample identification  labels are essential to the NHANES laboratory component. Labels support 
each study participant’ s (SP ’s) unique processing protocol. The laboratory record is created when the 
clinical laboratory technologist  opens a session for the first time. This record forms the basis for 
each SP ’s data in the database. Container labels are generated and assigned to vessel storage 
containers and allow a processed sample to be tracked from mobile examination center (MEC) 
processing through contract laboratory receipt.
