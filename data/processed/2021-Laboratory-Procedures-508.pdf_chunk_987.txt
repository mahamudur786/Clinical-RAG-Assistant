1.1.3 Fluorescent/U ltraviolet  Light Switch  
This switch provides on/off control for the fluorescent light and/or the ultraviolet (UV) light if 
present (optional). With the UV light option, the switch provides for on- center off -on operation so 
that both the fluorescent light and the UV light cannot be energized at the same time. The UV light is also interlocked, so it will only operate if the sliding window is closed. Proper care should be exercised when the UV light is on .
