Exposure to hepatitis C virus
x Over 60% of persons infected with HCV may develop chronic liver disease.
x Depending on whether active viral replication is occurring for HCV, the risk of transmission 
after a sharps injury from an HCV-infected person varies from 3% to 10%. The routes of infection are similar to HBV infection.
