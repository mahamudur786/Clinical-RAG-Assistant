and light scatter (VCS) of the diff mode only. This control is run at the beginning of each day. 
The Latron CP-X control is a ready- to-use suspension of latex particles used to monitor differential 
parameters on the Beckman Coulter DxH 800. These particles pass through the flow cell and 
produce characteristic electrical signals. It measures these signals as volume, conductivity, and light scatter.  
9.6.6 Coulter Interlaboratory Quality Assurance Program (IQAP)  
All DxH 800 instruments participate in Beckman Co ulter’s Interlaboratory Quality Assurance 
Program (IQAP). The Beckman Coulter Data Management System saves results of 6C cell controls 
in files. Laboratory staff transfer the files to a CD -RW and then send the disk to the Westat
