General principles 
x Surfaces must be routinely cleaned ﬁ  rst with detergent to remove any 
foreign and organic matter. Disinfection should follow cleaning. Do not apply disinfectant without cleaning as organic matter such as pus, blood urine, amniotic ﬂ  uid, etc. inhibits the action of the disinfectant by protecting 
microorganisms. A detergent disinfectant combination solution if available can be used for convenience.
x Spills must be cleaned immediately. Apply a higher concentration of 
disinfectant to the spill, then clean with detergent.
