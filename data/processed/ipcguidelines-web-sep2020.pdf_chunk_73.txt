Human reservoirs can be symptomatic (exhibiting signs and symptoms of the 
disease) or asymptomatic (without signs and symptoms) or they can be carriers (presence of organisms for varying periods without signs or symptoms). 
Asymptomatic cases and carriers are more likely to transmit the disease as 
precautions may not be taken since it is not known that the person is harbouring the organisms. Thus, standard precautions should be taken in all situations while dealing with patients even when the diagnosis is not known.
