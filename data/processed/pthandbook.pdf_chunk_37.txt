naming another to make medical decisions for 
that person if he or she becomes unable to 
make such decisions. In 1990, Congress 
approved legislation called the Patient Self-

medical facilitie sreimburse dby Medicaid and 
Medicare to educate patients about advance

of patien t care, including advance directives.
