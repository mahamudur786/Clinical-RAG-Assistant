Optimally , one would compare the CBC with differential between instruments with whole blood 
specimens,  but this is not feasible in NHANES since the MECs are not at the same location. In

addition, we can compare only two DxH 800 analyzers at a time since the third MEC is traveling to 
a new location and its DxH 800 is not operational during travel status. 
All DXH 800 analyzers can be compared using the American Pro ficiency Institute ’s Hematology- 5C 
surveys that are  provided three t imes each year. Each Hematology -5C survey  challenge contains 
five whole blood samples. These samples will be run on each MEC in duplicate (similar to 
participant specimens). We will also use five blinded samples if the MECs are within driv ing distance
