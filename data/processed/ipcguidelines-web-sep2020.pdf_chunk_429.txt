Perform bacterial culture and endotoxin assay on the dialysate and reverse osmosis 
water at least monthly and during outbreaks using standard quantitative methods, as per available guidelines. Dialysate should be tested at the end of the treatment day.
Reprocessing and reuse of dialyser sets
x Reprocessing is performed outside of the dialysis treatment area in a dedicated 
room. It is the act of cleaning, testing and ﬁ  lling the dialyser with disinfectant 
solution. 
x Reuse is performed in the treatment area. It refers to veriﬁ  cation of disinfection, 
rinsing and testing to ensure the complete removal of all disinfectants, and “reusing” the reprocessed dialyser for the designated (same) patient. Reuse and reprocessing must follow all applicable standards.
