• The laboratory cannot report study participant test results within its established period. 
If the reporting of data will exceed the agreed upon time frame, the MEC and final 
Report of Findings indicate the test results are not available. 
• Errors in the reported SP test results are detected. When errors are detected in the reporting of study pa rticipant results, the MEC clinician notifies the study participant by 
phone, followed by the issuance of a corrected report within a time period suitable to the study participant, but not to exceed 1 week. The corrected report clearly shows the 
corrected results in the title. Exact duplicates of the original as well as the corrected 
report are maintained for a minimum of 7 years.
