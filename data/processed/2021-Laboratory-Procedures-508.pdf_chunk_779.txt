9.6 Quality Control  
9.6.1 Introduction  
Most quantitative analytical procedures involve several operations, or steps, and each operation is 
subject to some inaccuracy, imprecision, or the possibility of a mistake. The immediate aim of quality control is to ensure that the analytical values produced by a clinical laboratory are sufficiently reliable for their intended purposes. A broader objective is to ensure that all laboratories produce 
analytical values that meet acceptable standards of precision and accuracy.
