abnormalit ies that resist lysing, or anything that increases the turbidity of the sample 
such as elevated levels of triglycerides.  
• MCV – very high WBC count, high concentration of very large platelets, agglutinated RBCs, RBC fragments that fall below the 36 -fL thres hold, or rigid RBCs. 
• RDW – very high WBC count, high concentration of very large or clumped platelets as 
in blood anticoagulated with oxalate or heparin, RBCs below the 36-fL threshold, two 
distinct populations of RBCs, RBC agglutinates, or rigid RBCs. 
• Plt – very small red blood cells near the upper threshold, cell fragments, clumped 
platelets as with oxalate or heparin, platelet fragments, or cellular debris near the lower platelet threshold.
