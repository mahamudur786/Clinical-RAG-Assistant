Policy for cleaning, sanitation and disinfection
The healthcare facility should develop a policy for cleaning, sanitation and 
disinfection of environmental surfaces. 
72 National Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities
The key elements are:
x The interiors and external areas and premises of the hospital should be kept 
clean and odour free.
x Solid waste and garbage should be removed and disposed of hygienically. 
x A hospital cleaning manual should be developed to provide detailed guidelines 
for procedures and practices. 
x There should be a cleaning schedule for daily, weekly and terminal cleaning. 
The cleaning process, be it for a single room, or ward, must be coordinated with the nurse in-charge.
