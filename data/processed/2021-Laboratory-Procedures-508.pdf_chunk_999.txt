capability of controlling lateral movement of airborne particulates. A cone of turbulence extends 
below the object and laminarity of the air stream is not regained until a point is reached downstream, approximately equal to three to six times the diameter of the object. Within the parameters of this cone, particles may be carried laterally by multidirectional eddy currents.  
Transfer of viable materials and manipulations that  may generate aerosols should not be performed 
above sterile or uninoculated materials. Items should be localized on the work surface in “ clean ” and 
“dirty” groups. 
Items of equipment in direct contact with the etiologic agent must remain in the cabinet unt il
