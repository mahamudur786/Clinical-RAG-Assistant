Removal of the normal ﬂ  ora can cause abnormal organisms to colonize a body 
site, e.g. antibiotics kill organisms such as drug-sensitive E. coli  and allow drug-
resistant organisms to colonize. Colonization can precede infection if the host defences are altered or impaired in some way, which can happen if the patient is on immunosuppressive drugs, has undergone surgery or interventions such as catheterization and intubation.
