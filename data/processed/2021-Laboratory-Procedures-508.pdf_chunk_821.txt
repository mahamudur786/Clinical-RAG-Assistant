calibration references and to apply any necessary correction factors. The calibration procedure uses 
replicate measurements of S -CAL calibrator. The S -CAL di vides the average result into the 
calibrator Assigned Value to give an Adjustment Factor. Then it obtains and adjusts an instrument reading according to the Adjustment Factor. 
The S -CAL is used to calibrate the DxH 800 at the beginning of each stand (once every 6 -8 weeks), 
after replacing any component dealing with dilution preparation, if the Beckman Coulter 
representative suggests it, if controls demonstrate unusual trends or are outside limits, or when the 
temperature varies by more than 10 °F (5.5°C) from the room temperature during the last 
calibration.
