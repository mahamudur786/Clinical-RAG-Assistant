3.9 Venipuncture Procedures  
Venipuncture should generally be performed using the m edian cubital, cephalic, or basilic veins in 
the left arm unless this arm is unsuitable. If the veins in the left arm are unsuitable, look for suitable 
veins in the right arm. If the veins in the antecubital space on both arms are not suitable, then look 
for veins in the forearm or dorsal side (top)  of the hand on the left arm/hand and then the right 
arm/hand. Be aware of SPs on dialysis who may have fistulas  in both arms located in the antecubital 
space and forearms, and switch to a hand draw with permissi on from the SP.
