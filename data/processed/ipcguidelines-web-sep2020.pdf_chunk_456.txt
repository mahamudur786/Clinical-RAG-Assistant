of laboratory services. Risk assessment can be simpliﬁ  ed into the following steps. 
Approach to risk assessment
x Identify hazards and who might be harmed (agent risk group, procedure, 
facility, staff, animals).
x Evaluate the risk (agent and procedure), consider the existing controls and 
assess the extent of the risks that remain.
x Mitigate the risk.
x Conduct a trial run using nonvirulent strains or simulants.
x Reassess the risk (any incidents/ deviations). 
x Remove gloves before handling phones, instruments or computers.
x Wear goggles and masks or face shields when splashing or spattering of 
specimens is expected. 
x Never store food or drinks in refrigerators or freezers containing 
microorganisms or clinical specimens.
