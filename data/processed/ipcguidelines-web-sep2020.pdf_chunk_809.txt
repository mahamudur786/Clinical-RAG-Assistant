Annex 10: Ventilation and design requirements
Ventilation and design requirements of the operation theatre are:# 
xAirborne bacteria originate primarily from the skin of persons in the operation theatre (OT). 
The bacteria carried on the skin reach the air through skin scales, which are constantly being shed by the persons in the room. After remaining suspended in the air, the skin scales carrying bacteria settle on various surfaces, equipment and on the ﬂ  oor of the OT. 
Appropriately circulated clean ﬁ  ltered air will remove airborne organisms.
xAir should be circulated by positive pressure through high efﬁ  ciency particulate air (HEPA)
