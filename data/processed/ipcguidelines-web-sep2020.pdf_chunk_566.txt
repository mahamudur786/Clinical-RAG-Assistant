Healthcare workers (HCWs) perform a wide range of activities in varying 
environments that can put their health and well-being at risk of harm. The 
administration of an HCF has the responsibility for the safety and health of its employees (Box 8.1). At the same time, HCWs are also responsible for adopting safe work practices and taking necessary precautions to mitigate the risk during the course of their work.
