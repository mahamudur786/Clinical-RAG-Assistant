Disposal of waste from the kitchen
Food returned to the kitchen should be discarded. These and other dietary wastes 
should be kept in bins lined by black plastic bags outside the dietary department, which are removed regularly.
Raw kitchen material after cutting vegetables, fruits, etc. can be composted if 
suitable space is available.
Waste stores and dustbins must be kept appropriately clean, free of pests and in 
closed conditions, and should be disposed of as per local rules and regulations, including those for plastic and other non-environment-friendly materials.
