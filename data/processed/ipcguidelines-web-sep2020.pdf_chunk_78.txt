Colonization and infection
Colonization refers to the presence of organisms in the body without causing any 
cellular damage or any response on the part of the host. Infection occurs when the organism causes cellular damage and a host response. Colonization with one organism may prevent the establishment of another more virulent organism at that body site. Colonizing organisms can be a part of the normal ﬂ  ora for a particular 
body site but cause infection at another body site, for example, E. coli  is a normal 
ﬂ  ora of the intestinal tract but it can cause infection in the urinary tract.
