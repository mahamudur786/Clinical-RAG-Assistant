segregation, collection, transportation, storage, and treatment to ﬁ  nal disposal. 
x Of the waste generated in healthcare settings, approximately 10% to 25% is 
hazardous but if not segregated properly, the entire waste becomes infectious thereby escalating the overall cost of waste management. The most practical approach to the management of biomedical waste is to identify and segregate infectious waste, which would in turn drastically reduce the cost of waste disposal in healthcare settings.
x Biomedical waste should be segregated into containers or bags at the point of 
generation in accordance with Annex 8.2. This includes placing different types of waste in different colour-coded bags and containers at the site of generation.
