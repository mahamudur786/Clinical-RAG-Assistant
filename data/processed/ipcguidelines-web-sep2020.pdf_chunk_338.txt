x A preoperative surgical hand scrub should be done for at least 5 minutes using 
an appropriate antiseptic scrub. Hands and forearms should be cleaned up to the elbows. 
x After performing the surgical hand scrub, hands should be kept up and away 
from the body (elbows in ﬂ  exed position) so that water runs from the tips of the 
ﬁ ngers toward the elbows and not vice versa. 
x If running water is not available, clean stored water can be used. Water should 
be stored in a bucket with a tap at one side to dispense water. If such a bucket is not available, clean water can be poured on the hands with the help of a container with a long handle. Another person should pour the water.
