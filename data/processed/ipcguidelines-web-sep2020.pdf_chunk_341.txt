Surgical attire
The surgical attire includes gloves, gowns, caps, mask, eye protection, waterproof aprons and footwear. It protects the patient from the risk of infection from the hair, skin, clothes and respiratory secretions of the surgical team. The surgical attire also protects the surgical team from the risk of exposure to blood and tissues of the patient during operation. (Steps for wearing the surgical attire are given in Annex 9.1.)

incision.
