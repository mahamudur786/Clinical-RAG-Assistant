3.7.1  Pregnancy Shared Exclusion Question  
For female SPs aged 12 -59 years, the shared exclusion pregnancy questions are enabled and are 
asked during the MEC exam ination in the first examination. Additionally, female SPs aged 8 to 11 
years who self -report as having started menses  are also asked the pregnancy exclusion question. 
Each question is asked only once, even when the question is relevant for more than one component. 
Some examinations, like phlebotomy, do not require all the shared exclusions to be asked. In this situation, there may be some questions answered in one examination and then disabled in the 
remaining examinations. Shared exclusion questions are component specific. Answers provided
