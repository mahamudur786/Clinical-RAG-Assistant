Cleaning agents and disinfectants for environmental use
A neutral detergent and warm water solution should be used for all routine and general cleaning. When a disinfectant is required for surface cleaning, e.g. after spillage or contamination with blood or body ﬂ  uids, or in special areas such as the 
surgical unit, dialysis unit and ICU, the manufacturer’s recommendations for use and occupational health and safety instructions should be followed. Table 5.4 lists the disinfectants used for the environment, their recommended use and precautions.
