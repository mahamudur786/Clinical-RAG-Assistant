specimens to various contract laboratories on a designated day. As necessary, other clinical 
laboratory scientists  assist in performing each of the steps listed below to complete the shipping 
procedures. 
Prior to the next stand, the laboratory staff creates address labels with the next stand ’s MEC address 
to use on the Class 9 labels. Place the next stand ’s MEC address label in the upper- left corner of the 
Class 9 label and place the appropriate Lab label in the upper- right corner of the Class 9 label. Enter 
the appropriate dry ice weight in kilograms (kg) in the blank space next to kg. If needed, trim both 
labels to fit in the space so they don’t cover up any information. Prepare Class 9 labels with the 
MEC address and Lab address for each shipping week.
