– This mean should be within the range stated on the control assay sheet and is 
considered the established target value . 
– Incorporate the SD range around the established target value and monitor throughout the dating of the product. Long- term sources of variability in the SD 
include different reagent bottles or lots, preventive maintenance, component replacement, and environmental factors.  
– The mean and SD measurements should be monitored and updated once sufficient data is collected.  
– When using the Coulter 6C assigned value or an instrument- specific mean, the 
instrument is considered well maintained and operating correctly if: ( 1) greater 
than or equal to 95 percent of the QC values fall within the EXPECTED
