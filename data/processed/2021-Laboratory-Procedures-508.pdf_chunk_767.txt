9-1  Laboratory Procedures 2021  
  
9.2.2 Identification of Specimens  
Personal identifiers (e.g., names) are not included on test specimens except the primary urine 
collection containers. The labels that contain the SP’s name and SP ID are destroyed or blacked out with a permanent marker before placing the container in the trash receptacle. NHANES uses a 
random internal specimen ID number to identify and track individual samples. The Integrated 
Survey Information System (ISIS) at Westat and NCHS maintains information that links the  
specimen ID number to the SP’ s name.  
9.2.3 Questions on Specimen Submission and Handling  
The Lab Component Lead/Assistant Lead addresses questions concerning specimen collection, 
including handling and testing.
