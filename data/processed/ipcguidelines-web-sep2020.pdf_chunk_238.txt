Air and ventilation
Introduction
Air is the source of airborne infections of which TB is the most common and endemic 
in India. Other airborne infections are measles and chicken pox. SARS and other serious respiratory viral infections can be transmitted through the air during aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation and bronchoscopy. Varicella (including disseminated zoster), highly pathogenic inﬂ  uenza, and smallpox may also be transmitted through the air route. Airborne infection occurs through droplet nuclei of less than 5 microns. These particles remain suspended in the air through various lengths of time and can travel over distances greater than 1 metre and at times even from room to room.
