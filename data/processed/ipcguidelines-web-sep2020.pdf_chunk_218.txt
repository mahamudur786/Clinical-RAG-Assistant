and replaced with clean items, e.g. bed linen, waterproof covering, oxygen humidiﬁ  ers, face mask, etc. as per the housekeeping policy.
 Procedures and practices for IPC 53
x Patient-care equipment and articles should be cleaned, disinfected or sterilized 
according to the disinfection policy (see Annex 5.1).
Transport of patients
Movement and transportation of patients from the isolation room or area should be restricted to essential purposes only. This will reduce the possibility of transmission of microorganisms in other areas of the HCF. 
Appropriate precautions should be taken during transportation to reduce the risk of 
transmission of microorganisms to other patients, HCWs or the hospital environment (surfaces or equipment).
