at least one HAI.
x In LMICs the frequency of ICU-acquired infection is at least 2–3-fold higher 
than that in high-income countries; device-associated infection densities are up to 13 times higher than those in the USA. 
x Similarly, newborns admitted in NICUs are at higher risk of acquiring HAI in 
developing countries, with infection rates 3 to 20 times higher than those in high-income countries.

Patient, therapy and environment-related risk factors for the development of HAI are:
74
