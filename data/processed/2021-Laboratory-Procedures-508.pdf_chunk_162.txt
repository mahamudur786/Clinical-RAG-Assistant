 Codes  
The f ield office and interviewing teams use “ Special Consideration” codes to describe SPs with 
special ne eds and/or reservations about the phlebotomy procedure to the MEC staff . The codes are 
part of the special consideration section of the MEC Appointment Schedule in the coordinator application. The phlebotomist prints the Session Preview Report for each ses sion and notes CB/NB 
codes under the Special Considerations column. All codes should be given special consideration and understood to be situational. 
• If an SP expresse d no reservations or concerns about phlebotomy during the home 
interview, then no code ap peared  and no special action was needed from MEC staff.
