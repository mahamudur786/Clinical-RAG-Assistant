Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) may be caused by 
cutaneous microorganisms that contaminate the catheter during insertion or migrate along the catheter track or by microorganisms from the hands of HCWs during interventions. The most frequently implicated organisms are: coagulase-negative Staphylococci, particularly Staph. epidermidis.  Other organisms are
