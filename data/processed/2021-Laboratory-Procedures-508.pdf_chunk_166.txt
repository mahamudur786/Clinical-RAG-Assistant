English  
When the phlebotomist must administer the venipuncture procedure to an SP who does not speak 
English and the phlebotomist does not speak the language of the SP, a translator who does speak the language of the SP assists the phlebotomist. The translator stays with the phlebotomist and the SP for the entire pr ocedure. It is very important that the phlebotomist be able to communicate 
with the SP if the SP becomes ill during the venipuncture. Refer to the MEC Operations manual for detailed instructions on the interpreter module.
