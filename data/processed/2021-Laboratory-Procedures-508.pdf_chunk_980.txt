• Calculate the difference between the two temperatures.  
• If the temperatures differ (+/ -) by more than 2 °C, contact the FES to have the digital 
temperature reading adjusted to be within the 2 °C limits. 
• After the adjustment is completed, repeat the process and record the temperature on a 
new Laboratory NIST Temperature Check Sheet . 
Repeat this process until all refrigerator, freezer, and room temperature digital readings are within 
2°C of the traceable thermometers.
