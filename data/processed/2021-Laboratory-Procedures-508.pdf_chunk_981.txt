with proper technique, provides an effective partial containment system for safe manipulation of 
moderate - and high- risk microorganisms . The vertical laminar airflow barrier prevents contaminated 
air from entering or escaping from the open-front work chamber, protecting the cabinet contents 
and the technologist. A high- efficiency filter system decontaminates both the incoming air and the 
exhaust. 
 Installation, Certification, and Maintenance  
Arrangements are made  for a certified engineer to perform the required annual certification that 
includes replacement of high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters as necessary.
