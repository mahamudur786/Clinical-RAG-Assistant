or analyzing a sample of persons (n>20) and examining the measurement output 
searching for interference. The appropriate procedures for verifying analytical specificity 
will vary by analytical method. Substances that interfere with the analysis in the 
reportable range are listed in the method procedure. 
• The reportable range of test results  is described in the documentation of the 
analytical procedure.  
• Reference range (normal range) of test results, if available, is described in the documentation of the analytical procedure and on the test report. 
• Other pertinent performance specifications  that are required for adequate method 
performance are specified in the documentation of the ana lytical procedure.
