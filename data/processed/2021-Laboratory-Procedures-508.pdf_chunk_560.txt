including the parameter. 
6.20 Limitations of Method:  Specimen Rejection, Interfering 
Substances, and Conditions  
This method limits samples to human whole blood. 
6.20.1  Specimen Rejection  
Reject clotted specimens and recollect  if clinician  requests.  
6.20.2  Interfering Substances and Conditions  
Because the Coulter directly measures RBC, WBC, Hgb, and Diff percent , it is most important to 
concentrate on analytes and substances that interfere with these parameters.  The Coulter calculates 
HCT, MCH, MCHC, and DIFF # parameters. The Coulter derives MCV, RDW, PLT, and MPV 
from RBC or platelet histograms.  The following are possible interfering substances or conditions: 
• Abnormal BUN, glucose, or sodium levels could affect the MCV.
