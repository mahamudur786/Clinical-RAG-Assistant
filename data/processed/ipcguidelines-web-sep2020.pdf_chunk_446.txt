While safe practices in the laboratory are primarily intended to prevent morbidity 
due to infections in laboratory workers, laboratory-associated infections may impact public health, leading to secondary cases in the community. For example, household transmission of pathogens (e.g. inﬂ  uenza A) is well documented. Therefore, prevention of laboratory-associated infections has an individual as well public health impact.
