they are transmitted by the airborne route. If an accident involving such agents was to occur in a BSL-2 laboratory, it would n ot be possible

considered as part of a risk assessment exercise and selection of appropriate control measures. Laboratory SOPs need to specify  how the 
work may be conducted safely.
