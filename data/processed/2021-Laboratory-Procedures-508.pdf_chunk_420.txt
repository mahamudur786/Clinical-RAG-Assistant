• The Coulter LIN- X Linearity control (store at 2 –8°C) is recommended for verification 
of the reportable range and linearity, and for calibration assessment of the WBC, RBC, 
HGB, and PLT parameters . 
– When ana lyzing LIN -X Linearity Controls patient flags will occur. These flags 
should be ignored if a numerical result is obtained. When voteout (- - - - - ), 
incomplete computation (.....) or over range (+++++) flags occur, the sample should be repeated. Some level s may generate a non -blood (N) flag. DO NOT
