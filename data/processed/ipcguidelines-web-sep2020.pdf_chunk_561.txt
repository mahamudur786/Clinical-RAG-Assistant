10. Implement control and prevention measures
The primary goal is to stop transmission, not necessarily to ﬁ  nd the source. Thus, 
a variety of control measures should be implemented targeting various possibilities based on initial observations.
131 A few of the immediate control measures to be 
implemented are given in Table 7.3.
Examples of HAI outbreak control measures
x Reinforcing hand hygiene 
x Establishing a barrier between infected/ colonized patients and non-infected/ 
colonized patients 
x Enhanced cleaning 
x Review disinfection of environment, equipment 
x Remove suspected common source(s)
