Challenges during epidemics
x Ampliﬁ  cation of the epidemic.  If the HCF has not put in place adequate 
measures to prevent and control infection, it may amplify an epidemic by spreading the infection to patients, staff and visitors. On leaving the hospital these infected individuals may boost transmission in the community.
x Overwhelming demand for healthcare resources.  Human and material 
resources, including hospital space and medicines, may not be adequate to meet the demand, particularly in the case of an epidemic lasting several weeks or months.
x The health facility has to alter its priorities  and adapt its work routines 
to mount a coordinated, systemic response to a rapidly evolving, potentially complex situation.
