x The HBV vaccine in generally administered in a three-dose vaccine series at 0-, 1- and 
6-month schedules. The vaccine should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle because gluteal injection leads to poor immunogenicity. 
x The efﬁ  cacy of the vaccine is >90% after the third dose in terms of formation of a protective

x Test for anti-HBs titres after 1–2 months of completion of 3 doses of vaccine. A sero-
