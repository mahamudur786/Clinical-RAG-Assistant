F. IPC in immunocompromised patients
Emergence of new clinical syndromes and infections due to organisms with antimicrobial resistance have altered the pattern of opportunistic infections. The range of organisms that can cause infection is very broad and the infection can progress rapidly.
The recognition of infection in immunocompromised patients particularly transplant 
recipients is a challenge as the signs and symptoms of infection are suppressed and may even be absent. Moreover, fever may be caused by non-infectious conditions such as graft rejection, reaction to drugs which makes the diagnosis of infection difﬁ cult. 
Transplant recipients are at increased risk of HAIs, which can occur due to
