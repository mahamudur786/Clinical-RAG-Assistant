The key components are: 
x System change:  ensuring that the necessary infrastructure is in place to allow 
HCWs to practise hand hygiene. This has two essential elements: R Access to a safe, continuous water supply as well as to soap and towels; 
R Readily accessible alcohol-based hand rub at the point of care. 
x Training/ education:  providing regular training on the importance of hand 
hygiene, based on the “My 5 moments for hand hygiene” approach (Fig. 4.3), and the correct steps for hand rubbing and handwashing, to all HCWs. 
x Evaluation and feedback:  monitoring hand hygiene practices and 
infrastructure, along with related perceptions and knowledge among HCWs, while providing performance and results feedback to staff.
